Natural Language Processing and Schizophrenia: A Scoping Review of Uses and Challenges,"(1) Background: Approximately 1% of the global population is affected by schizophrenia, a disorder marked by cognitive deficits, delusions, hallucinations, and language issues. It is associated with genetic, neurological, and environmental factors, and linked to dopaminergic hyperactivity and neurotransmitter imbalances. Recent research reveals that patients exhibit significant language impairments, such as reduced verbal output and fluency. Advances in machine learning and natural language processing show potential for early diagnosis and personalized treatments, but additional research is required for the practical application and interpretation of such technology. The objective of this study is to explore the applications of natural language processing in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. (2) Methods: A scoping review was conducted across multiple electronic databases, including Medline, PubMed, Embase, and PsycInfo. The search strategy utilized a combination of text words and subject headings, focusing on schizophrenia and natural language processing. Systematically extracted information included authors, population, primary uses of the natural language processing algorithms, main outcomes, and limitations. The quality of the identified studies was assessed. (3) Results: A total of 516 eligible articles were identified, from which 478 studies were excluded based on the first analysis of titles and abstracts. Of the remaining 38 studies, 18 were selected as part of this scoping review. The following six main uses of natural language processing were identified: diagnostic and predictive modeling, followed by specific linguistic phenomena, speech and communication analysis, social media and online content analysis, clinical and cognitive assessment, and linguistic feature analysis. (4) Conclusions: This review highlights the main uses of natural language processing in the field of schizophrenia and the need for more studies to validate the effectiveness of natural language processing in diagnosing and treating schizophrenia",PubMed
Harnessing generative AI to annotate the severity of all phenotypic abnormalities within the Human Phenotype Ontology,"0.1There are thousands of human phenotypes which are linked to genetic variation. These range from the benign (white eyelashes) to the deadly (respiratory failure). The Human Phenotype Ontology has categorised all human phenotypic variation into a unified framework that defines the relationships between them (e.g. missing arms and missing legs are both abnormalities of the limb). This has made it possible to perform phenome-wide analyses, e.g. to prioritise which make the best candidates for gene therapies. However, there is currently limited metadata describing the clinical characteristics / severity of these phenotypes. With >17500 phenotypic abnormalities across >8600 rare diseases, manual curation of such phenotypic annotations by experts would be exceedingly labour-intensive and time-consuming. Leveraging advances in artificial intelligence, we employed the OpenAI GPT-4 large language model (LLM) to systematically annotate the severity of all phenotypic abnormalities in the HPO. Phenotypic severity was defined using a set of clinical characteristics and their frequency of occurrence. First, we benchmarked the generative LLM clinical characteristic annotations against ground-truth labels within the HPO (e.g. phenotypes in the  Cancer HPO branch were annotated as causing cancer by GPT-4). True positive recall rates across different clinical characteristics ranged from 89-100% (mean=96%), clearly demonstrating the ability of GPT-4 to automate the curation process with a high degree of fidelity. Using a novel approach, we developed a severity scoring system that incorporates both the nature of the clinical characteristic and the frequency of its occurrence. These clinical characteristic severity metrics will enable efforts to systematically prioritise which human phenotypes are most detrimental to human health, and best targets for therapeutic intervention",medrxiv
Leveraging hierarchical structures for genetic block interaction studies using the hierarchical transformer,"1.Initially introduced in 1909 by William Bateson, classic epistasis (genetic variant interaction) refers to the phenomenon that one variant prevents another variant from a different locus from manifesting its effects. The potential effects of genetic variant interactions on complex diseases have been recognized for the past decades. Moreover, It has been studied and demonstrated that leveraging the combined SNP effects within the genetic block can significantly increase calculation power, reducing background noise, ultimately leading to novel epistasis discovery that the single SNP statistical epistasis study might overlook. However, it is still an open question how we can best combine gene structure representation modelling and interaction learning into an end-to-end model for gene interaction searching. Here, in the current study, we developed a neural genetic block interaction searching model that can effectively process large SNP chip inputs and output the potential genetic block interaction heatmap. Our model augments a previously published hierarchical transformer architecture (Liu and Lapata, 2019) with the ability to model genetic blocks. The cross-block relationship mapping was achieved via a hierarchical attention mechanism which allows the sharing of information regarding specific phenotypes, as opposed to simple unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods e.g. PCA. Results on both simulation and UK Biobank studies show our model brings substantial improvements compared to traditional exhaustive searching and neural network methods

16S rRNA gene sequencing for bacterial identification and infectious disease diagnosis,"16S rRNA gene sequence is the most common housekeeping genetic marker to study bacterial phylogeny and taxonomy. Therefore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing has the potential to identify novel bacteria and diagnose bacteria. This study compared 16S rRNA gene sequencing with conventional PCR for bacterial identification and disease diagnosis. The bacterial community in healthy and diseased hosts was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 16S rRNA gene sequencing is more sensitive than conventional PCR in detecting bacteria. Moreover, 16S rRNA gene sequencing is adequate to identify novel bacteria. 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that most pathogenic bacteria persist in diseased or healthy hosts in different abundance. Pathogenic bacteria, such as well-known chicken pathogen Avibacterium paragallinarum, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, and Gallibacterium anatis, were identified as indicator species of diseased samples. Alpha diversity analysis showed that the healthy group species is significantly higher than in the diseased groups. Beta diversity analysis also demonstrated differences between healthy and infected groups. The study concluded that 16S rRNA gene sequencing is a more sensitive method for detecting pathogens, and microbiota analysis can distinguish between healthy and diseased samples. Eventually, 16S rRNA gene sequencing has represented the potential in human and animal clinical diagnosis and novel bacterial identification",biorxiv
A Systematic Review of Testing and Evaluation of Healthcare Applications of Large Language Models (LLMs),"1ImportanceLarge Language Models (LLMs) can assist in a wide range of healthcare-related activities. Current approaches to evaluating LLMs make it difficult to identify the most impactful LLM application areas.  ObjectiveTo summarize the current evaluation of LLMs in healthcare in terms of 5 components: evaluation data type, healthcare task, Natural Language Processing (NLP)/Natural Language Understanding (NLU) task, dimension of evaluation, and medical specialty.  Data SourcesA systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science was performed for studies published between 01-01-2022 and 02-19-2024.  Study SelectionStudies evaluating one or more LLMs in healthcare.  Data Extraction and SynthesisThree independent reviewers categorized 519 studies in terms of data used in the evaluation, the healthcare tasks (the what) and the NLP/NLU tasks (the how) examined, the dimension(s) of evaluation, and the medical specialty studied.  ResultsOnly 5% of reviewed studies utilized real patient care data for LLM evaluation. The most popular healthcare tasks were assessing medical knowledge (e.g. answering medical licensing exam questions, 44.5%), followed by making diagnoses (19.5%), and educating patients (17.7%). Administrative tasks such as assigning provider billing codes (0.2%), writing prescriptions (0.2%), generating clinical referrals (0.6%) and clinical notetaking (0.8%) were less studied. For NLP/NLU tasks, the vast majority of studies examined question answering (84.2%). Other tasks such as summarization (8.9%), conversational dialogue (3.3%), and translation (3.1%) were infrequent. Almost all studies (95.4%) used accuracy as the primary dimension of evaluation; fairness, bias and toxicity (15.8%), robustness (14.8%), deployment considerations (4.6%), and calibration and uncertainty (1.2%) were infrequently measured. Finally, in terms of medical specialty area, most studies were in internal medicine (42%), surgery (11.4%) and ophthalmology (6.9%), with nuclear medicine (0.6%), physical medicine (0.4%) and medical genetics (0.2%) being the least represented.  Conclusions and RelevanceExisting evaluations of LLMs mostly focused on accuracy of question answering for medical exams, without consideration of real patient care data. Dimensions like fairness, bias and toxicity, robustness, and deployment considerations received limited attention. To draw meaningful conclusions and improve LLM adoption, future studies need to establish a standardized set of LLM applications and evaluation dimensions, perform evaluations using data from routine care, and broaden testing to include administrative tasks as well as multiple medical specialties.  Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow are healthcare applications of large language models (LLMs) currently evaluated?  FindingsStudies rarely used real patient care data for LLM evaluation. Administrative tasks such as generating provider billing codes and writing prescriptions were understudied. Natural Language Processing (NLP)/Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks like summarization, conversational dialogue, and translation were infrequently explored. Accuracy was the predominant dimension of evaluation, while fairness, bias and toxicity assessments were neglected. Evaluations in specialized fields, such as nuclear medicine and medical genetics were rare.  MeaningCurrent LLM assessments in healthcare remain shallow and fragmented. To draw concrete insights on their performance, evaluations need to use real patient care data across a broad range of healthcare and NLP/NLU tasks and medical specialties with standardized dimensions of evaluation",medrxiv
Genomic epidemiology of the primary methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clones causing invasive infections in Paraguayan children,"2.Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the major human pathogens, causing a wide range of infections from food poisoning to necrotizing pneumonia, endocarditis, or septicemia. It could carry numerous resistance genes and virulence factors, some of which are related to the severity of the infection, being also regarded as a potential ""Super Bug"". In Paraguay, the prevalence of CC30-ST30-IV clones is the leading cause of S. aureus infections both at the regional level and in pediatric population. Here we aimed to deeply analyze the genomic features of MRSA isolates that cause invasive infections in Paraguayan children. An observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study was designed to analyze representative MRSA isolates of the main clones identified between 2009 to 2013 in Paraguayan children. All the genetically linked MRSA isolates were recovered from diverse clinical sources, patients, and hospitals at broad gap periods. Cases were primarily community-acquired, which excludes in-hospital transmission or outbreaks. MRSA isolates were analyzed with short-read paired-end sequencing and assessed for the virulome, resistome, and phylogenetic relationships. The pan-genomic analysis of these clones revealed three major and different clonal complexes (CC8, CC30, and CC5), each composed of clones closely related to each other, despite having different spa types. Furthermore, multiple virulence and resistance genes were identified for the first time in this study, pointing out the complex virulence profiles of MRSA circulating in the country. This study opens a wide range of new possibilities for future projects and trials to improve the existing knowledge on the epidemiology of MRSA circulating in Paraguay.  3. Impact statementThe increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a public health problem worldwide. The most frequent MRSA clones identified in Paraguay in previous studies were (including community and hospital-acquired) the Pediatric (CC5-ST5-IV), the Cordobes-Chilean (CC5-ST5-I), the SouthWest Pacific (CC30-ST30-IV) and the Brazilian (CC8-ST239-III) clones. In this study, the pan-genomic analysis of the most representative MRSA clones circulating in invasive infection in Paraguayan children over ten years (2009-2019), such as the CC30-ST30-IV, CC5-ST5-IV, and CC8-ST8-IV, were carried out to evaluate their genetic diversity, their virulence factors repertoire, and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms revealed multiple virulences and resistance genes pointing out the complex virulence profiles of MRSA circulating in Paraguay. Our work is the first genomic study of MRSA in Paraguay and will contribute to the development of genomic surveillance in the region and our understanding of this pathogens global epidemiology.  4.

Feasibility of identifying factors related to Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in real-world data,"A comprehensive understanding of factors associated with Alzheimers disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD) will significantly enhance efforts when designing new studies to develop new treatments and identify high-risk populations for prevention. We reviewed existing meta-analyses and review articles on AD/ADRD risk and preventive factors, extracting 477 risk factors across 10 categories from 537 studies. An interactive knowledge graph was created to share our study findings. Most risk factors can be found in structured Electronic Health Records (EHRs), with clinical narratives also providing valuable information. However, assessing genomic risk factors using real-world data (RWD) like EHRs remains a challenge, as genetic testing for AD/ADRD is still not a common practice and poorly documented in both structured and unstructured EHRs. Given the constant and rapid evolution of AD/ADRD research, using natural language processing (NLP) for literature mining emerges as a viable method to continually and automatically update our knowledge graph",medrxiv
Feasibility of Identifying Factors Related to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia in Real-World Data,"A comprehensive view of factors associated with AD/ADRD will significantly aid in studies to develop new treatments for AD/ADRD and identify high-risk populations and patients for prevention efforts. In our study, we summarized the risk factors for AD/ADRD by reviewing existing meta-analyses and review articles on risk and preventive factors for AD/ADRD. In total, we extracted 477 risk factors in 10 categories from 537 studies. We constructed an interactive knowledge map to disseminate our study results. Most of the risk factors are accessible from structured Electronic Health Records (EHRs), and clinical narratives show promise as information sources. However, evaluating genomic risk factors using RWD remains a challenge, as genetic testing for AD/ADRD is still not a common practice and is poorly documented in both structured and unstructured EHRs. Considering the constantly evolving research on AD/ADRD risk factors, literature mining via NLP methods offers a solution to automatically update our knowledge map","PubMed,arXiv"
Modeling cancer dependency with deep graph models,"A fundamental premise for precision oncology is a catalog of diverse actionable targets that could enable personalized treatment. Large scale Genome-wide lost-of-function screens such as cancer dependency map have systematically identified single gene vulnerabilities in numerous cell lines. However, it remains challenging to scale such analyses to many clinical samples and untangle molecular networks underlying observed vulnerabilities. We developed a deep learning framework, DepGPS, combing graph neural networks with transformers to model the network interactions underlying tumor vulnerabilities. Our model demonstrated an improved ability to predict context-specific vulnerabilities over existing models and showed a higher responsiveness in perturbation analysis. Furthermore, perturbation induced dependency changes by our model demonstrated utility to support context-aware identification of synthetic lethal genes. Overall, our model represents a valuable tool to extend tumor vulnerability analyses to broader range of subjects and could help to decipher molecular networks dictating context-specific tumor vulnerabilities",biorxiv
Impaired complement regulation drives chronic lung allograft dysfunction after lung transplantation,"A greater understanding of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) pathobiology, the primary cause of mortality after lung transplantation, is needed to improve outcomes. The complement system links innate to adaptive immune responses and is activated early post-lung transplantation to form the C3 convertase, a critical enzyme that cleaves the central complement component C3. We hypothesized that LTx recipients with a genetic predisposition to enhanced complement activation have worse CLAD-free survival mediated through increased adaptive alloimmunity. We interrogated a known functional C3 polymorphism (C3R102G) that increases complement activation through impaired C3 convertase inactivation in two independent LTx recipient cohorts. C3R102G, identified in at least one out of three LTx recipients, was associated with worse CLAD-free survival, particularly in the subset of recipients who developed donor-specific antibodies (DSA). In a mouse orthotopic lung transplantation model, impaired recipient complement regulation resulted in more severe obstructive airway lesions when compared to wildtype controls, despite only moderate differences in graft-infiltrating effector T cells. Impaired complement regulation promoted the intragraft accumulation of memory B cells and antibody-secreting cells, resulting in increased DSA levels. In summary, genetic predisposition to complement activation is associated with B cell activation and worse CLAD-free survival.  BRIEF SUMMARYLung transplant recipients genetically predisposed to impaired complement regulation demonstrate worse chronic rejection-free survival. This phenotype is associated with intragraft B cell-activation and donor-specific antibodies",biorxiv
Murine Progeria Model Exhibits Delayed Fracture Healing with Dysregulated Local Immune Response,"ABSTRACTO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSBone fracture is one of the most globally prevalent injuries, with an estimated 189 million bone fractures occurring annually. Delayed union or nonunion occurs in up to 15% of fractures and involves the interruption or complete failure of bone continuity following fracture. Preclinical testing is essential to support the translation of novel strategies to promote improved fracture repair treatment, but there is a paucity of small animal models that recapitulate clinical attributes associated with delayed fracture healing. This study explores whether the Zmpste24-/- (Z24-/-) knockout mouse model of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome presents with delayed fracture healing. Leveraging the previously characterized Z24-/- phenotype of genomic instability, epigenetic changes, and fragility, we hypothesize that these underlying alterations will lead to significantly delayed fracture healing relative to age-matched wild type (WT) controls.  MethodsWT and Z24-/- mice received intramedullary fixed tibia fractures at [~]12 weeks of age. Mice were sacrificed throughout the time course of repair for the collection of organs that would provide information regarding the local (fracture callus, bone marrow, inguinal lymph nodes) versus peripheral (peripheral blood, contralateral tibia, abdominal organs) tissue microenvironments. Analyses of these specimens include histomorphometry, CT, mechanical strength testing, protein quantification, gene expression analysis, flow cytometry for cellular senescence, and immunophenotyping.  ResultsZ24-/- mice demonstrated a significantly delayed rate of healing compared to WT mice with consistently smaller fracture calli containing higher proportion of cartilage and less bone after injury. Cellular senescence and pro-inflammatory cytokines were elevated in the Z24-/- mice before and after fracture. These mice further presented with a dysregulated immune system, exhibiting generally decreased lymphopoiesis and increased myelopoiesis locally in the bone marrow, with more naive and less memory T cell but greater myeloid activation systemically in the peripheral blood. Surprisingly, the ipsilateral lymph nodes had increased T cell activation and other pro-inflammatory NK and myeloid cells, suggesting that elevated myeloid abundance and activation contributes to an injury-specific hyperactivation of T cells.  ConclusionTaken together, these data establish the Z24-/- progeria mouse as a model of delayed fracture healing that exhibits decreased bone in the fracture callus, with weaker overall bone quality, immune dysregulation, and increased cellular senescence. Based on this mechanism for delayed healing, we propose this Z24-/- progeria mouse model could be useful in testing novel therapeutics that could address delayed healing.  The Translational Potential of this ArticleThis study employs a novel animal model for delayed fracture healing that researchers can use to screen fracture healing therapeutics to address the globally prevalent issue of aberrant fracture healing",biorxiv
"Virtual Labs and Designer Bugs - Generative AI, Synthetic Biology and National Security","AI technologies can pose a major national security concern. AI programs could be used to develop chemical and biological agents which circumvent existing protective measures or medical treatments, or to design pathogens with capabilities they do not naturally possess (gain-of-function research). Although Australia has a strong legislative framework relating to research into genetically modified organisms, the framework requires the interaction of more than 10 different government departments, universities and funding agencies. Further, there are few guidelines about the responsible use of AI in biological research where existing laws and policies do not apply to research that is conducted ""virtually"", even where that research may have national security implications. This article explores these under-scrutinised concepts in Australia's biological security frameworks",PubMed
Latent Diffusion For Conditional Generation of Molecules,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDesigning a small molecule therapeutic is a challenging multi-parameter optimization problem. Key properties, such as potency, selectivity, bioavailability, and safety must be jointly optimized to deliver an effective clinical candidate. We present COATI-LDM, a novel application of latent diffusion models to the conditional generation of property-optimized, drug-like small molecules. Diffusive generation of latent molecular encodings, rather than direct diffusive generation of molecular structures, offers an appealing way to handle the small and mismatched datasets that are common for molecular properties. We benchmark various diffusion guidance schemes and sampling methods against a pre-trained autoregressive transformer and genetic algorithms to evaluate control over potency, expert preference, and various physicochemical properties. We show that conditional diffusion allows control over the properties of generated molecules, with practical and performance advantages over competing methods. We also apply the recently introduced idea of particle guidance to enhance sample diversity. We prospectively survey a panel of medicinal chemists and determine that we can conditionally generate molecules that align with their preferences via a learned preference score. Finally, we present a partial diffusion method for the local optimization of molecular properties starting from a seed molecule. Conditional generation of small molecules using latent diffusion models on molecular encodings provides a highly practical and flexible alternative to prior molecular generation schemes",biorxiv
Transfer Learning Of Gene Expression Using Reactome,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWIn clinical research, translating findings from model organisms to human applications remains challenging due to biological differences between species as well as limitations of orthologous, and homologous, gene comparisons, which is fraugt with information loss as well as many-to-many mapping. To address these issues, we introduce a novel Universal Gene Embedding (UGE) model that leverages transformer-based few-shot learning for species-agnostic transfer learning with heterogeneous domain adaptation. The UGE model, trained on a dataset of gene expression from ten organs across rats and mice, establishes a unified biological latent space that effectively represents genes from any organ or species. By focusing on reactomes--comprehensive profiles of gene expression responses to drugs--the UGE model enables functional gene mapping across species based on the similarities of these profiles. Our contributions include a gene reactome vector prediction module, a robust framework for mapping drug-induced gene expression patterns across species, strategies for optimizing experimental design, and enhanced gene mapping precision. These advancements provide a new tool for genetic research and a new paradigm for cross-species insights, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of gene function, drug responses, and the translation of findings from model organisms to human clinical applications",biorxiv

Genomic Foundationless Models: Pretraining Does Not Promise Performance,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe success of Large Language Models has inspired the development of Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) through similar pretraining techniques. However, the relationship between pretraining performance and effectiveness in downstream genomic tasks remains unclear. Additionally, the high computational cost of pre-training raises questions about its cost-efficiency. To assess the usefulness of pre-training in genomics, we evaluated seven different GFMs across various bench-marks, comparing them to their counterparts with randomly initialized weights. Surprisingly, we found that randomly initialized models can match or even surpass the performance of pretrained GFMs in finetuning and feature extraction tasks. We also discovered that pretrained GFMs fail to capture clinically relevant genetic mutations, which are crucial for understanding genetic disorders and phenotypic traits. Our results indicate that most of the current pretrained GFMs lack a ""foundational"" understanding of genomics and provide minimal utility, even for basic tasks such as sequence classification. These findings collectively highlight the need for critically rethinking the pretraining approaches for genomics. Our code is available at https://github.com/m42-health/gfm-random-eval",biorxiv

An integrative taxonomic treatment of the Mycetophilidae (Diptera: Bibionomorpha) from Singapore reveals 115 new species on 730km2,"Abstract""Open ended"" or ""dark taxa"" are species-rich clades that are so abundant and diverse that conventional taxonomic methods tend to struggle with the onslaught of specimens and species. New approaches based on presorting specimens to putative species with low-cost DNA barcodes may make tackling these taxa manageable. However, this will still require limiting the geographic scope of taxonomic revisions, given that most countries and biogeographic regions will have too many specimens and species for comprehensive coverage. We demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a revision of the Mycetophilidae fungus gnats (Diptera) of Singapore. The material revised here was obtained from 496 samples collected with 71 Malaise traps placed at 107 sites in different habitats in Singapore: mangroves, swamp forests, freshwater swamps, primary rainforests, and different types of secondary forests (old, maturing, young, urban). Based on molecular and morphological data for 1,454 specimens, we delimit 120 species of 23 genera. Of these, only five were species previously described. The remaining 115 species are new to science and described here. We name, however, only 98 of these species since 14 species are currently only known from females and we cannot prepare a fully satisfying morphological diagnosis (Manota spp. A-G and Neoempheria spp. A-G), and three species lack molecular data (Epicypta sp. A, Epicypta sp. B, and Neoempheria sp. H). To assess congruence between species delimited with DNA barcodes (3% clusters) and morphology, we determined a match ratio and found it to be overall high (95%) with even higher match ratios (99%) observed for MOTUs clustered at 5% with Objective Clustering and MOTUs obtained with ABGD set to (P=0.060). Overall, the ratio of undescribed to described is an astonishing 20:1. Only revising the Singapore fauna increases the number of described species of Oriental Mycetophilidae by about 25%, highlighting the size of the taxonomic impediment for fungus gnats. Most of the Singapore Mycetophilidae diversity belongs to three genera--Neoempheria Osten-Sacken (31 species), Epicypta Winnertz (29 species) and Manota Williston (14 species), but we also describe a new genus-- Integricypta, gen. n., which is the putative sistergroup of Aspidionia Colless--belonging to the Mycetophilinae Mycetophilini based on three species. The species sequenced, illustrated, and named are: Leptomorphus rafflesi, sp. n.; Monoclona simhapura, sp. n.; Azana demeijeri, sp. n.; Azana leekongchiani, sp. n.

(Mycetophilinae). The previously described species are Metanepsia malaysiana Kallweit, Eumanota racola Soli, Parempheriella defectiva (Edwards), Neoempheria dizonalis (Edwards) (all known from Sumatra and/or the Malaysian peninsula), and Chalastonepsia hokkaidensis Kallweit a species spread in east Asia. The mycomyine genus Vecella Wu & Yang is here proposed as a new synonym to Parempheriella, with P. guadunana (Wu & Yang), n. comb. corresponding to an additional Palearctic species of Parempheriella. Barcodes for a second set of 1,493 Singapore mycetophilid specimens suggest the presence of an additional 18 MOTUs. We thus estimate that approximately 85% of all the Singapore species that routinely enter Malaise traps are identified or described here. The revision concludes with a discussion of the biogeography and generic composition of the mycetophilid fauna at the southern end of the Malay Peninsula.  Zusammenfassung""Open-ended"" oder ""Dark Taxa"" sind artenreiche Klade, die so abundant und arteinreich sind, dass die herkommlichen taxonomischen Methoden angesichts der gro{beta}en Anzahl von Exemplaren und Arten nicht gut funktionieren. Neue Ansatze, die auf das Vorsortierung von Exemplaren mit DNA Barcodes bis zum Artniveau basieren, erlauben es jetzt aber solche Taxa zu revidieren. Allerdings kann auch mit DNA Barcodes, nur die Fauna eines vergleichsweise kleinen Gebietes bearbeiten werden, weil fur die meisten Lander und biogeografischen Regionen zu viele Exemplare und Arten abgedeckt werden mussten. Wir demonstrieren hier wie eine solche Revision durchgefuhrt werden kann. Wir revidieren hier die Pilzmucken (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) von Singapur, die mit Malaisefallen gefangen werden konnen. Das hier uberarbeitete Material stammt aus 496 Malaise-Fallenproben, die mit 71 Malaise-Fallen an 107 Sammelstellen in verschiedenen Habitaten gefangen wurden: Mangroven, Sumpfwalder, Su{beta}wassersumpfe, Primarregenwalder und Sekundarwalder. Basierend auf molekularen und morphologischen Daten fur mehr als 1454 Tiere grenzen wir 120 Arten mit molekularen und morphologischen Daten ab, wobei nur 5 dieser Arten bereits beschrieben sind. Die verbleibenden 115 werden hier beschrieben. Allerdings benennen wir nur 98 Arten, da fur zwei Arten molekulare Daten fehlen und fur 14 weitere Arten derzeit nur Weibchen bekannt sind. Daher konnen wir derzeit keine zufriedenstellende morphologische Diagnose erstellen. Daruber hinaus fehlen molekulare Daten fur drei Arten (Epicypta sp. A, Epicypta sp. B und Neoempheria sp. H). Was die Artgrenzen betrifft, so stimmen die molekularen und morphologischen Daten in den meisten Fallen uberein (match ratio: 95% fur 3% MOTUs). Eine noch hohere ""match ratio"" von 99% wird fur 5% und ABGD MOTUs (P=0,060) beobachtet. Insgesamt ist das Verhaltnis zwischen unbeschrieben und beschrieben erstaunlich hoch (20:1), und die Uberarbeitung der singapurer Fauna erhoht die Anzahl der beschriebenen Arten in der Orientalischen Region um uber 25%. Dies unterstreicht den Ausma{beta} des ""taxonomic impediments"" fur Pilzmucken. Die meisten der Mycetophilidenarten in Singapur gehoren zu drei von 22 Gattungen - Neoempheria Osten-Sacken (31 Arten), Epicypta Winnertz (29 Arten) und Manota Williston (14 Arten), aber wir beschreiben hier auch eine neue Gattung, Integricypta, gen. n. basierend auf drei Arten. Die Gattung gehort zu den Mycetophilinae Mycetophilini und ist die mutma{beta}liche Schwestergruppe von Aspidionia Colless. Die sequenzierten, illustrierten und benannten Arten sind: Leptomorphus rafflesi, sp. n.; Monoclona simhapura, sp. n.; Azana demeijeri, sp. n.; Azana leekongchiani, sp. n.

Combinatorial phenotypic landscape enables bacterial resistance to phage infection,"AbstractSuccess of phage therapies is limited by bacterial defenses against phages. While a large variety of anti- phage defense mechanisms has been characterized, how expression of these systems is distributed across individual cells and how their combined activities translate into protection from phages has not been studied. Using bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing, we profiled the transcriptomes of [~]50,000 cells from cultures of a human pathobiont, Bacteroides fragilis, infected with a lytic bacteriophage. We quantified the asynchronous progression of phage infection in single bacterial cells and reconstructed the infection timeline, characterizing both host and phage transcriptomic changes as infection unfolded. We discovered a subpopulation of bacteria that remained uninfected and determined the heterogeneously expressed host factors associated with protection. Each cells vulnerability to phage infection was defined by combinatorial phase-variable expression of multiple genetic loci, including capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis pathways, restriction-modification systems (RM), and a previously uncharacterized operon likely encoding fimbrial genes. By acting together, these heterogeneously expressed phase-variable systems and anti-phage defense mechanisms create a phenotypic landscape where distinct protective combinations enable the survival and re-growth of bacteria expressing these phenotypes without acquiring additional mutations. The emerging model of complementary action of multiple protective mechanisms heterogeneously expressed across an isogenic bacterial population showcases the potent role of phase variation and stochasticity in bacterial anti-phage defenses.  One Sentence SummaryCombinatorial phenotypic states with differential vulnerability to phage infection across a Bacteroides fragilis population enable a small number of super-resistant bacterial cells to evade the phage without the need for acquiring mutations",biorxiv
Accessory Spleen Mimicking an Intrahepatic Neoplasm: A Rare Case Report,"Accessory spleen and splenosis are two types of ectopic spleen. An accessory spleen can be found in various sites in the abdomen, but an intrahepatic accessory spleen is very rare though many case reports of intrahepatic splenosis are available. This case report presents the incidental diagnosis of accessory spleen in the liver of a 57-year-old male while undergoing laparoscopic diaphragmatic repair. The patient had a history of splenectomy 27 years ago for hereditary spherocytosis, but his routine haemogram did not show any features of the ectopic splenic function. Intraoperatively, a mass was suspected in the liver and was resected. Histopathology revealed an accessory spleen with well-preserved red and white pulp architecture. Though a history of splenectomy suggested a diagnosis of splenosis, a well-encapsulated and preserved splenic architecture confirmed the diagnosis of accessory spleen. Accessory spleen or splenosis can be diagnosed radiologically using Tc-99m-labeled heat-denatured red blood cells (HRBC) and Tc-99m sulfur colloid scans, but the gold standard is histopathological examination. Ectopic spleen is mostly asymptomatic but usually results in unnecessary surgeries as it is difficult to differentiate from benign or malignant tumors. Thus, a high degree of suspicion and awareness is necessary for early and prompt diagnosis",PubMed
Interpretable Droplet Digital PCR Assay for Trustworthy Molecular Diagnostics,"Accurate molecular quantification is essential for advancing research and diagnostics in fields such as infectious diseases, cancer biology, and genetic disorders. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has emerged as a gold standard for achieving absolute quantification. While computational ddPCR technologies have advanced significantly, achieving automatic interpretation and consistent adaptability across diverse operational environments remains a challenge. To address these limitations, we introduce the intelligent interpretable droplet digital PCR (I2ddPCR) assay, a comprehensive framework integrating front-end predictive models (for droplet segmentation and classification) with GPT-4o multimodal large language model (MLLM, for context-aware explanations and recommendations) to automate and enhance ddPCR image analysis. This approach surpasses the state-of-the-art models, affording 99.05% accuracy in processing complex ddPCR images containing over 300 droplets per image with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). By combining specialized neural networks and large language models, the I2ddPCR assay offers a robust and adaptable solution for absolute molecular quantification, achieving a sensitivity capable of detecting low-abundance targets as low as 90.32 copies/{\mu}L. Furthermore, it improves model's transparency through detailed explanation and troubleshooting guidance, empowering users to make informed decisions. This innovative framework has the potential to benefit molecular diagnostics, disease research, and clinical applications, especially in resource-constrained settings",arXiv
MMGCN: Multi-modal multi-view graph convolutional networks for cancer prognosis prediction,"Accurate prognosis prediction for cancer patients plays a significant role in the formulation of treatment strategies, considerably impacting personalized medicine. Recent advancements in this field indicate that integrating information from various modalities, such as genetic and clinical data, and developing multi-modal deep learning models can enhance prediction accuracy. However, most existing multi-modal deep learning methods either overlook patient similarities that benefit prognosis prediction or fail to effectively capture diverse information due to measuring patient similarities from a single perspective. To address these issues, a novel framework called multi-modal multi-view graph convolutional networks (MMGCN) is proposed for cancer prognosis prediction. Initially, we utilize the similarity network fusion (SNF) algorithm to merge patient similarity networks (PSNs), individually constructed using gene expression, copy number alteration, and clinical data, into a fused PSN for integrating multi-modal information. To capture diverse perspectives of patient similarities, we treat the fused PSN as a multi-view graph by considering each single-edge-type subgraph as a view graph, and propose multi-view graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with a view-level attention mechanism. Moreover, an edge homophily prediction module is designed to alleviate the adverse effects of heterophilic edges on the representation power of GCNs. Finally, comprehensive representations of patient nodes are obtained to predict cancer prognosis. Experimental results demonstrate that MMGCN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on four public datasets, including METABRIC, TCGA-BRCA, TCGA-LGG, and TCGA-LUSC, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve achieving 0.827 ± 0.005, 0.805 ± 0.014, 0.925 ± 0.007, and 0.746 ± 0.013, respectively. Our study reveals the effectiveness of the proposed MMGCN, which deeply explores patient similarities related to different modalities from a broad perspective, in enhancing the performance of multi-modal cancer prognosis prediction.

Complete elimination of hyperleukocytosis risk in AML through early high-quality disease remission,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with hyperleukocytosis (HL) is a severe medical emergency associated with high mortality rates and poor prognosis. Prompt and urgent treatment is crucial to address this medical emergency. This study aims to elucidate appropriate diagnostic thresholds for HL and investigate underlying mechanisms and potential targeted therapies. X-tile software was employed to analyze white blood cell (WBC) count thresholds in AML patients using data from TCGA and TARGET AML databases. METASCAPE and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were conducted to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying HL in AML. Potential molecular targeted drugs were identified using the CELLMINER platform. Analysis revealed that a WBC count threshold of 75×10<sup>9</sup>/L, rather than the conventional 100×10<sup>9</sup>/L, is more appropriate for diagnosing HL in adult AML patients. This revised threshold could aid clinicians in identifying a greater number of patients requiring immediate intervention. Significant correlations were observed between HL and specific mutations, including NPM1, FLT3, and DNMT3A. For pediatric AML patients, the HL threshold was determined to be 165×10<sup>9</sup>/L. Achieving complete remission (CR) or deeper levels of remission significantly reduces the risks associated with HL. The reduction in risk can lead to survival outcomes for HL patients that are comparable to those of non-hyperleukocytosis patients. Differential gene expression analysis indicated that downregulation of cell adhesion molecules is implicated in HL pathogenesis. Potential targeted therapies for AML with HL include Bcl2 inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors. Clinical observations demonstrated that the addition of Bcl2 inhibitors, such as Venetoclax, to standard therapy results in a rapid reduction in WBC counts, thereby reducing tumor burden and providing prompt symptom relief. Combining these targeted drugs with conventional therapies appears promising in mitigating risks associated with HL. Lower diagnostic thresholds for HL in AML, identifies critical genetic correlations, and highlights effective molecular targeted therapies. Proactive early treatment is crucial for achieving deep remission and reducing HL risk. Future therapeutic strategies should consider integrating molecular targeted drugs with conventional therapies to improve outcomes for patients facing this high-risk hematological emergency",PubMed
A review of treatment options employed in relapsed/refractory AML,"Acute myeloid leukemia [AML] is a heterogenous group of primary hematopoietic neoplasms arising from myeloid precursor cells. Up to 50% of patients failed to achieve remission with initial therapy and go on to develop refractory AML. Whenever possible, enrollment in a clinical trial in view of the paucity of evidence surrounding a clearly superior treatment modality is recommended, and the therapy which provides the best chance for cure post remission is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HCT], with much of everyday clinical decision-making in relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML surrounding the choice of the least toxic regimen that could achieve remission and enable prompt HCT. We discuss a variety of treatment modalities employed in the R/R AML setting beginning with traditional cytotoxic regimens. We then turn our attention to targeted therapies that have shown efficacy in specific patient populations such as the IDH inhibitors and FLT3 inhibitors and lastly, we turn our attention to immunotherapeutic agents employed in the R/R in the setting, such as CD33 inhibitors and bispecific antibodies. It appears increasingly clear that approaching AML as a homogenous disease entity is unsatisfactory in view of the variations in such disease factors as cytogenetic and molecular markers, age, and disease severity at presentation; all of which contribute significantly to heterogeneity of the disease. Moving forward, treating AML would likely require tailored therapy following advances in technology such as molecular profiling, drug sensitivity and resistance testing",PubMed
[LORENZO'S OIL AND ADRENOLEUKODYSTROPHY EXAMINING AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOL INTENDED FOR CONDUCTING LITERATURE SEARCHES AND ANALYSES],"Adrenoleukodystrophy is a genetic metabolic disorder characterized by a heterogeneous phenotype. Its severe form, known as cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, involves unpredictable cerebral damage and progressive central nervous system deterioration. This rare condition became famous because of a Hollywood movie in which the Italian parents of a child with the condition supposedly discovered a medication for treating the condition. But real life does not emulate movies and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the standard of care for patients diagnosed at an early disease stage. This article describes a patient with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy diagnosed at an advanced disease stage. The literature search aimed to identify therapies to prevent further deterioration suggested autologous hematopoietic stem cell-based gene therapy and metabolic therapies. Consensus is a Chat GPT-based AI tool trained on millions of scientific publications, intended for conducting evidence-based literature searches and analyses. The case presented was used to conduct a parallel literature review using Consensus. While the generated output contained no hallucinations (a problem often seen with other large language models), the quality of the selected articles and their interpretation in the context of the specific case fell short of that achieved by experienced researchers or physicians",PubMed
Human spinal interneurons repair the injured spinal cord through synaptic integration,"Advances in cell therapy offer promise for some of the most devastating neural injuries, including spinal cord injury (SCI). Endogenous VSX2-expressing spinal V2a interneurons have been implicated as a key component in plasticity and therapeutically driven recovery post-SCI. While transplantation of generic V2a neurons may have therapeutic value, generation of human spinal V2a neurons with rostro-caudal specificity and assessment of their functional synaptic integration with the injured spinal cord has been elusive. Here, we efficiently differentiated optogenetically engineered cervical V2a spinal interneurons (SpINs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells and tested their capacity to form functional synapses with injured diaphragm motor networks in a clinically-relevant sub-acute model of cervical contusion injury. Neuroanatomical tracing and immunohistochemistry demonstrated transplant integration and synaptic connectivity with injured host tissue. Optogenetic activation of transplanted human V2a SpINs revealed functional synaptic connectivity to injured host circuits, culminating in improved diaphragm activity assessed by electromyography. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of host supraspinal pathways revealed functional innervation of transplanted cells by host neurons, which also led to enhanced diaphragm contraction indicative of a functional neuronal relay. Single cell analyses pre- and post-transplantation suggested the in vivo environment resulted in maturation of cervical SpINs that mediate the formation of neuronal relays, as well as differentiation of glial progenitors involved in repair of the damaged spinal cord. This study rigorously demonstrates feasibility of generating human cervical spinal V2a interneurons that develop functional host-transplant and transplant-host connectivity resulting in improved muscle activity post-SCI",biorxiv
Evaluating and Enhancing Japanese Large Language Models for Genetic Counseling Support: Comparative Study of Domain Adaptation and the Development of an Expert-Evaluated Dataset,"Advances in genetics have underscored a strong association between genetic factors and health outcomes, leading to an increased demand for genetic counseling services. However, a shortage of qualified genetic counselors poses a significant challenge. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a potential solution for augmenting support in genetic counseling tasks. Despite the potential, Japanese genetic counseling LLMs (JGCLLMs) are underexplored. To advance a JGCLLM-based dialogue system for genetic counseling, effective domain adaptation methods require investigation. This study aims to evaluate the current capabilities and identify challenges in developing a JGCLLM-based dialogue system for genetic counseling. The primary focus is to assess the effectiveness of prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and instruction tuning within the context of genetic counseling. Furthermore, we will establish an experts-evaluated dataset of responses generated by LLMs adapted to Japanese genetic counseling for the future development of JGCLLMs. Two primary datasets were used in this study: (1) a question-answer (QA) dataset for LLM adaptation and (2) a genetic counseling question dataset for evaluation. The QA dataset included 899 QA pairs covering medical and genetic counseling topics, while the evaluation dataset contained 120 curated questions across 6 genetic counseling categories. Three enhancement techniques of LLMs-instruction tuning, RAG, and prompt engineering-were applied to a lightweight Japanese LLM to enhance its ability for genetic counseling. The performance of the adapted LLM was evaluated on the 120-question dataset by 2 certified genetic counselors and 1 ophthalmologist (SK, YU, and AY). Evaluation focused on four metrics: (1) inappropriateness of information, (2) sufficiency of information, (3) severity of harm, and (4) alignment with medical consensus. The evaluation by certified genetic counselors and an ophthalmologist revealed varied outcomes across different methods. RAG showed potential, particularly in enhancing critical aspects of genetic counseling. In contrast, instruction tuning and prompt engineering produced less favorable outcomes. This evaluation process facilitated the creation an expert-evaluated dataset of responses generated by LLMs adapted with different combinations of these methods. Error analysis identified key ethical concerns, including inappropriate promotion of prenatal testing, criticism of relatives, and inaccurate probability statements. RAG demonstrated notable improvements across all evaluation metrics, suggesting potential for further enhancement through the expansion of RAG data. The expert-evaluated dataset developed in this study provides valuable insights for future optimization efforts. However, the ethical issues observed in JGCLLM responses underscore the critical need for ongoing refinement and thorough ethical evaluation before these systems can be implemented in health care settings",PubMed
BioDiscoveryAgent: An AI Agent for Designing Genetic Perturbation Experiments,"Agents based on large language models have shown great potential in accelerating scientific discovery by leveraging their rich background knowledge and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce BioDiscoveryAgent, an agent that designs new experiments, reasons about their outcomes, and efficiently navigates the hypothesis space to reach desired solutions. We demonstrate our agent on the problem of designing genetic perturbation experiments, where the aim is to find a small subset out of many possible genes that, when perturbed, result in a specific phenotype (e.g., cell growth). Utilizing its biological knowledge, BioDiscoveryAgent can uniquely design new experiments without the need to train a machine learning model or explicitly design an acquisition function as in Bayesian optimization. Moreover, BioDiscoveryAgent, using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieves an average of 21% improvement in predicting relevant genetic perturbations across six datasets, and a 46% improvement in the harder task of non-essential gene perturbation, compared to existing Bayesian optimization baselines specifically trained for this task. Our evaluation includes one dataset that is unpublished, ensuring it is not part of the language model's training data. Additionally, BioDiscoveryAgent predicts gene combinations to perturb more than twice as accurately as a random baseline, a task so far not explored in the context of closed-loop experiment design. The agent also has access to tools for searching the biomedical literature, executing code to analyze biological datasets, and prompting another agent to critically evaluate its predictions. Overall, BioDiscoveryAgent is interpretable at every stage, representing an accessible new paradigm in the computational design of biological experiments with the potential to augment scientists' efficacy",arXiv
Molecular requirements of chromogranin B for the long-sought anion shunter of regulated secretion,"All eukaryotes utilize regulated secretion to release molecular signals packaged in secretory granules for local and remote signaling. An anion shunt conductance was first suggested in secretory granules of bovine chromaffin cells nearly five decades ago. Biochemical identity of this conductance remains undefined. CLC-3, an intracellular Cl-/H+ exchanger, was proposed as a candidate sixteen years ago, which, however, was contested experimentally. Here, we show that chromogranin B (CHGB) makes the kernel of the long-sought anion shunter in cultured and primary neuroendocrine cells and its channel functions are essential to proper granule maturation. Intragranular pH measurements and cargo maturation assays revealed that normal granular acidification, proinsulin-insulin conversion, and dopamine-loading in neuroendocrine cells all rely on functional CHGB+ channels. Primary {beta}-cells from Chgb-/- mice exhibited persistent granule deacidification, which suffices to uplift plasma proinsulin level, diminish glucose-induced 2nd-phase insulin secretion and dwindle monoamine content in chromaffin granules from the knockout mice. Data from targeted genetic manipulations, dominant negativity of a deletion mutant lacking channel-forming parts and tests of CLC-3/5 and ANO-1/2 all exclude CHGB-less channels from anion shunting in secretory granules. The highly conserved CHGB+ channels thus function in regulated secretory pathways in neuronal, endocrine, exocrine and stem cells of probably all vertebrates.  HIGHLIGHTSO_LILoss of CHGB channel functions impairs secretory granule acidification in neuroendocrine cells, which necessitates anion shunt conduction. C_LIO_LICHGB{Delta}MIF, a mutant unable to form a functional Cl- channel, exerts negative dominance on endogenous CHGB and results in granule deacidification in cultured cells. C_LIO_LINeither CLC-3 & -5 nor ANO-1 & -2 participate in the CHGB-mediated granule acidification. Clcn3 knockout effects on regulated secretion can be attributed to its functions in endosomal and endolysosomal compartments. C_LIO_LIPrimary Chgb-/- {beta}-cells exhibit persistent granule deacidification, presenting a unifying mechanism for disparate mouse phenotypes: hyperproinsulinemia, near abrogation of 2nd phase insulin release after glucose challenge and diminution of monoamine contents in chromaffin granules.

"THE EFFECT OF SELECTED COFFEE CONSTITUENTS ON MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION IN AN EARLY ALZHEIMER DISEASE CELL MODEL
==========
THE EFFECT OF SELECTED COFFEE CONSTITUENTS ON MITOCHON-DRIAL DYSFUNCTION IN AN EARLY ALZHEIMER DISEASE CELL MODEL","Alzheimer disease (AD) is an emerging medical problem worldwide without any cure yet. By 2050, more than 152 million people will be affected. AD is characterized by mitochondrial dys-function (MD) and increased amyloid beta (A{beta}) levels. Coffee is one of the most commonly consumed beverages. It has many bioactive and neuroprotective ingredients of which caffeine (Cof), kahweohl (KW) and cafestol (CF) shows a variety of pharmacological properties such as anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Effects of Cof, KW, and CF were tested in a cel-lular model of AD on MD and A{beta}. SH-SY5Y-APP695 cells were incubated with 50{micro}M Cof, 1{micro}M CF and 1{micro}M KW for 24h. The energetic metabolite ATP was determined using a luciferase-catalyzed bioluminescence assay. The activity of mitochondrial respiration chain complexes was assessed by high-resolution respirometry using a Clarke electrode. Expression levels genes were deter-mined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The levels of amyloid {beta}-protein (A{beta}1-40) were measured using homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF). ROS levels, cAMP levels, and peroxidase activity were determined using a fluorescence assay. The combination of Cof, KW and CF significantly increased ATP levels. The combination had neither a significant effect on MMP, on activity of respiration chain complexes, nor on A{beta}1-40 levels. cAMP levels were slightly increased after incubation with the combination, but not the peroxi-dase activity. Pyruvate levels and the lactate-pyruvate-ration but not lactate levels were signifi- cantly enhanced. No effect was seen on the expression level of lactate dehydrogenase and py-ruvate dehydrogenase kinase. In some experiments we have tested the single substances. They showed significant results especially in ATP, lactate and pyruvate values compared to the con-trol. The combinations have a lesser effect on mitochondrial dysfunction in cells and none on A{beta} production. Whereas ATP levels and pyruvate levels were significantly increased. This suggests a change in glycolysis in neuronal cells harbouring human genes relevant for AD",biorxiv
Identifying Progression-Specific Alzheimer's Subtypes Using Multimodal Transformer,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, yet its current treatments are limited to stopping disease progression. Moreover, the effectiveness of these treatments remains uncertain due to the heterogeneity of the disease. Therefore, it is essential to identify disease subtypes at a very early stage. Current data-driven approaches can be used to classify subtypes during later stages of AD or related disorders, but making predictions in the asymptomatic or prodromal stage is challenging. Furthermore, the classifications of most existing models lack explainability, and these models rely solely on a single modality for assessment, limiting the scope of their analysis. Thus, we propose a multimodal framework that utilizes early-stage indicators, including imaging, genetics, and clinical assessments, to classify AD patients into progression-specific subtypes at an early stage. In our framework, we introduce a tri-modal co-attention mechanism (Tri-COAT) to explicitly capture cross-modal feature associations. Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (slow progressing = 177, intermediate = 302, and fast = 15) were used to train and evaluate Tri-COAT using a 10-fold stratified cross-testing approach. Our proposed model outperforms baseline models and sheds light on essential associations across multimodal features supported by known biological mechanisms. The multimodal design behind Tri-COAT allows it to achieve the highest classification area under the receiver operating characteristic curve while simultaneously providing interpretability to the model predictions through the co-attention mechanism",PubMed
Multimodal Neurodegenerative Disease Subtyping Explained by ChatGPT,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease; yet its currently available treatments are limited to stopping disease progression. Moreover, effectiveness of these treatments is not guaranteed due to the heterogenetiy of the disease. Therefore, it is essential to be able to identify the disease subtypes at a very early stage. Current data driven approaches are able to classify the subtypes at later stages of AD or related disorders, but struggle when predicting at the asymptomatic or prodromal stage. Moreover, most existing models either lack explainability behind the classification or only use a single modality for the assessment, limiting scope of its analysis. Thus, we propose a multimodal framework that uses early-stage indicators such as imaging, genetics and clinical assessments to classify AD patients into subtypes at early stages. Similarly, we build prompts and use large language models, such as ChatGPT, to interpret the findings of our model. In our framework, we propose a tri-modal co-attention mechanism (Tri-COAT) to explicitly learn the cross-modal feature associations. Our proposed model outperforms baseline models and provides insight into key cross-modal feature associations supported by known biological mechanisms",arXiv
An AI-Driven Framework for Discovery of BACE1 Inhibitors for Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects over 51 million individuals globally. The {beta}-secretase (BACE1) enzyme is responsible for the production of amyloid beta (A{beta}) plaques in the brain. The accumulation of A{beta} plaques leads to neuronal death and the impairment of cognitive abilities, both of which are fundamental symptoms of AD. Thus, BACE1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for AD. Previous BACE1 inhibitors have faced various issues related to molecular size and blood-brain barrier permeability, preventing any of them from maturing into FDA-approved AD drugs. In this work, a generative AI framework is developed as the first AI application to the de novo generation of BACE1 inhibitors. Through a simple, robust, and accurate molecular representation, a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP), and a Genetic Algorithm (GA), the framework generates and optimizes over 1,000,000 candidate inhibitors that improve upon the bioactive and pharmacological properties of current BACE1 inhibitors. Then, the molecular docking simulation models the candidate inhibitors and identifies 14 candidate drugs that exhibit stronger binding interactions to the BACE1 active site than previous candidate BACE1 drugs from clinical trials. Overall, the framework successfully discovers BACE1 inhibitors and candidate AD drugs, accelerating the developmental process for a novel AD treatment",biorxiv
Deep learning analyses of splicing variants identify the link of PCP4 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe motor neuron disease, with most sporadic cases lacking clear genetic causes. Abnormal pre-mRNA splicing is a fundamental mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases. For example, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) loss-of-function (LOF) causes widespread RNA mis-splicing events in ALS. Additionally, splicing mutations are major contributors to neurological disorders. However, the role of intronic variants driving RNA mis-splicing in ALS remains poorly understood. To address this, we developed Spliformer to predict RNA splicing. Spliformer is a transformer-based deep learning model trained and tested on splicing events from the GENCODE database, as well as RNA-seq data from blood and central nervous system tissues. We benchmarked Spliformer against SpliceAI and Pangolin using testing datasets and paired whole-genome sequencing (WGS) with RNA-seq data. We further developed the Spliformer-motif model to identify splicing regulatory motifs. We analyzed Clinvar dataset to identify the link of splicing variants with disease pathogenicity. Additionally, we analyzed WGS data of ALS patients and controls to identify common intronic splicing variants linked to ALS risk or disease phenotypes. We also profiled rare intronic splicing variants in ALS patients to identify known or novel ALS-associated genes. Minigene assays were employed to validate candidate splicing variants. Finally, we measured spine density in neurons with a specific gene knockdown or those expressing a TDP-43 disease-causing mutant. Spliformer accurately predicts the possibilities of a nucleotide within a pre-mRNA sequence being a splice donor, acceptor, or neither. Spliformer outperformed SpliceAI and Pangolin in both speed and accuracy in tested splicing events and/or paired WGS/RNA-seq data. Spliformer-motif successfully identified canonical and novel splicing regulatory motifs. In Clinvar dataset, splicing variants are highly related to disease pathogenicity. Genome-wide analyses of common intronic splicing variants nominated one variant linked to ALS progression. Deep learning analyses of WGS data from 1,370 ALS patients revealed rare splicing variants in reported ALS genes (such as PTPRN2 and CFAP410, validated through minigene assays and RNA-seq), and TDP-43 LOF related RNA mis-splicing genes (such as PTPRD). Further genetic analysis and minigene assays nominated PCP4 and TMEM63A as ALS-associated genes. Functional assays demonstrated that PCP4 is critical for maintaining spine density and can rescue spine loss in neurons expressing a disease-causing TDP-43 mutant. In summary, we developed Spliformer and Spliformer-motif that accurately predict and interpret pre-mRNA splicing. Our findings highlight an intronic genetic mechanism driving RNA mis-splicing in ALS and nominate PCP4 as an ALS-associated gene",PubMed
"Clinical signatures of genetic epilepsies precede diagnosis in electronic medical records of 32,000 individuals","An early genetic diagnosis can guide the time-sensitive treatment of individuals with genetic epilepsies. However, most genetic diagnoses occur long after disease onset. We aimed to identify early clinical features suggestive of genetic diagnoses in individuals with epilepsy through large-scale analysis of full-text electronic medical records. We extracted 89 million time-stamped standardized clinical annotations using Natural Language Processing from 4,572,783 clinical notes from 32,112 individuals with childhood epilepsy, including 1925 individuals with known or presumed genetic epilepsies. We applied these features to train random forest models to predict SCN1A-related disorders and any genetic diagnosis. We identified 47,774 age-dependent associations of clinical features with genetic etiologies a median of 3.6 years before molecular diagnosis. Across all 710 genetic etiologies identified in our cohort, neurodevelopmental differences between 6 to 9 months increased the likelihood of a later molecular diagnosis 5-fold (P < .0001, 95% CI = 3.55-7.42). A later diagnosis of SCN1A-related disorders (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.91) or an overall positive genetic diagnosis (AUC = 0.82) could be reliably predicted using random forest models. Clinical features predictive of genetic epilepsies precede molecular diagnoses by up to several years in conditions with known precision treatments. An earlier diagnosis facilitated by automated electronic medical records analysis has the potential for earlier targeted therapeutic strategies in the genetic epilepsies",PubMed
Single-cell Heterogeneity-aware Transformer-guided Multiple Instance Learning for Cancer Aneuploidy Prediction from Whole Slide Histopathology Images,"Aneuploidy is a hallmark of aggressive malignancies associated with therapeutic resistance and poor survival. Measuring aneuploidy requires expensive specialized techniques that are not clinically applicable. Deep learning analysis of routine histopathology slides has revealed associations with genetic mutations. However, existing studies focus on image patches or tiles, and there is no prior work that predicts aneuploidy using single-cell analysis. Here, we present a single-cell heterogeneity-aware and transformer-guided deep learning framework to predict aneuploidy from whole slide histopathology images. First, we perform nuclei segmentation and classification to obtain individual cancer cells, which are clustered into multiple subtypes. The cell subtype distributions are computed to measure cancer cell heterogeneity. Additionally, morphological features of different cell subtypes are extracted. Further, we leverage a multiple instance learning module with Transformer, which encourages the network to focus on the most informative cancer cells. Lastly, a hybrid network is built to unify cell heterogeneity, morphology, and deep features for aneuploidy prediction. We train and validate our method on two public datasets from TCGA: lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), with 339 and 245 patients. Our model achieves promising performance with AUC of 0.818 (95% CI: 0.718-0.919) and 0.827 (95% CI: 0.704-0.949) on the LUAD and HNSC test sets, respectively. Through extensive ablation and comparison studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of the model and superior performance over alternative networks. In conclusion, we present a novel deep learning approach to predict aneuploidy from histopathology images, which could inform personalized cancer treatment",PubMed
Rare disease variant curation from literature: assessing gaps with creatine transport deficiency in focus,"Approximately 4-8% of the world suffers from a rare disease. Rare diseases are often difficult to diagnose, and many do not have approved therapies. Genetic sequencing has the potential to shorten the current diagnostic process, increase mechanistic understanding, and facilitate research on therapeutic approaches but is limited by the difficulty of novel variant pathogenicity interpretation and the communication of known causative variants. It is unknown how many published rare disease variants are currently accessible in the public domain. This study investigated the translation of knowledge of variants reported in published manuscripts to publicly accessible variant databases. Variants, symptoms, biochemical assay results, and protein function from literature on the SLC6A8 gene associated with X-linked Creatine Transporter Deficiency (CTD) were curated and reported as a highly annotated dataset of variants with clinical context and functional details. Variants were harmonized, their availability in existing variant databases was analyzed and pathogenicity assignments were compared with impact algorithm predictions. 24% of the pathogenic variants found in PubMed articles were not captured in any database used in this analysis while only 65% of the published variants received an accurate pathogenicity prediction from at least one impact prediction algorithm. Despite being published in the literature, pathogenicity data on patient variants may remain inaccessible for genetic diagnosis, therapeutic target identification, mechanistic understanding, or hypothesis generation. Clinical and functional details presented in the literature are important to make pathogenicity assessments. Impact predictions remain imperfect but are improving, especially for single nucleotide exonic variants, however such predictions are less accurate or unavailable for intronic and multi-nucleotide variants. Developing text mining workflows that use natural language processing for identifying diseases, genes and variants, along with impact prediction algorithms and integrating with details on clinical phenotypes and functional assessments might be a promising approach to scale literature mining of variants and assigning correct pathogenicity. The curated variants list created by this effort includes context details to improve any such efforts on variant curation for rare diseases",PubMed
Familial hypercholesterolaemia in children and adolescents from 48 countries: a cross-sectional study,"Approximately 450 000 children are born with familial hypercholesterolaemia worldwide every year, yet only 2·1% of adults with familial hypercholesterolaemia were diagnosed before age 18 years via current diagnostic approaches, which are derived from observations in adults. We aimed to characterise children and adolescents with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH) and understand current approaches to the identification and management of familial hypercholesterolaemia to inform future public health strategies. For this cross-sectional study, we assessed children and adolescents younger than 18 years with a clinical or genetic diagnosis of HeFH at the time of entry into the Familial Hypercholesterolaemia Studies Collaboration (FHSC) registry between Oct 1, 2015, and Jan 31, 2021. Data in the registry were collected from 55 regional or national registries in 48 countries. Diagnoses relying on self-reported history of familial hypercholesterolaemia and suspected secondary hypercholesterolaemia were excluded from the registry; people with untreated LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) of at least 13·0 mmol/L were excluded from this study. Data were assessed overall and by WHO region, World Bank country income status, age, diagnostic criteria, and index-case status. The main outcome of this study was to assess current identification and management of children and adolescents with familial hypercholesterolaemia. Of 63 093 individuals in the FHSC registry, 11 848 (18·8%) were children or adolescents younger than 18 years with HeFH and were included in this study; 5756 (50·2%) of 11 476 included individuals were female and 5720 (49·8%) were male. Sex data were missing for 372 (3·1%) of 11 848 individuals. Median age at registry entry was 9·6 years (IQR 5·8-13·2). 10 099 (89·9%) of 11 235 included individuals had a final genetically confirmed diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia and 1136 (10·1%) had a clinical diagnosis. Genetically confirmed diagnosis data or clinical diagnosis data were missing for 613 (5·2%) of 11 848 individuals. Genetic diagnosis was more common in children and adolescents from high-income countries (9427 [92·4%] of 10 202) than in children and adolescents from non-high-income countries (199 [48·0%] of 415). 3414 (31·6%) of 10 804 children or adolescents were index cases. Familial-hypercholesterolaemia-related physical signs, cardiovascular risk factors, and cardiovascular disease were uncommon, but were more common in non-high-income countries. 7557 (72·4%) of 10 428 included children or adolescents were not taking lipid-lowering medication (LLM) and had a median LDL-C of 5·00 mmol/L (IQR 4·05-6·08). Compared with genetic diagnosis, the use of unadapted clinical criteria intended for use in adults and reliant on more extreme phenotypes could result in 50-75% of children and adolescents with familial hypercholesterolaemia not being identified. Clinical characteristics observed in adults with familial hypercholesterolaemia are uncommon in children and adolescents with familial hypercholesterolaemia, hence detection in this age group relies on measurement of LDL-C and genetic confirmation. Where genetic testing is unavailable, increased availability and use of LDL-C measurements in the first few years of life could help reduce the current gap between prevalence and detection, enabling increased use of combination LLM to reach recommended LDL-C targets early in life.

Applications of Artificial Intelligence to Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an umbrella term that represents a new technology for simulating and expanding human intelligence by using machines and computer systems. It consists of methods such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP). In the era of big data, AI has emerged as an essential tool for improving the detection of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's diseases (AD), Parkinson's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc. AI with its ability to extract critical information from the mass of data has enabled scientists to deal with various types of large-volume data, including genetic data, imaging data, and clinical data, rapidly generated in the course of neurodegenerative disease research. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the literature on current AI applications in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Firstly, bioinformatics and AI approaches to identify potential biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD are reviewed. Secondly, the use of ML and DL methods to analyze Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data for a better understanding of disease progression and predicting patient outcomes is discussed. Finally, the use of AI methods including NLP for Electronic Health Record (EHR) data analysis to extract meaningful information and identify patterns that may contribute to early diagnosis and treatment planning are reviewed. The potential benefits of AI-based approaches in improving patient outcomes and the challenges associated with their implementations are also discussed. Overall, this paper highlights the promise of AI in transforming the diagnosis and management of neurodegenerative diseases",PubMed
ChatGPT accurately performs genetic counseling for gynecologic cancers,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems such as ChatGPT can take medical examinations and counsel patients regarding medical diagnosis. We aim to quantify the accuracy of the ChatGPT V3.4 in answering commonly asked questions pertaining to genetic testing and counseling for gynecologic cancers. Forty questions were formulated in conjunction with gynecologic oncologists and adapted from professional society guidelines and ChatGPT version 3.5 was queried, the version that is readily available to the public. The two categories of questions were genetic counseling guidelines and questions pertaining to specific genetic disorders. The answers were scored by two attending Gynecologic Oncologists according to the following scale: 1) correct and comprehensive, 2) correct but not comprehensive, 3) some correct, some incorrect, and 4) completely incorrect. Scoring discrepancies were resolved by additional third reviewer. The proportion of responses earning each score were calculated overall and within each question category. ChatGPT provided correct and comprehensive answers to 33/40 (82.5%) questions, correct but not comprehensive answers to 6/40 (15%) questions, partially incorrect answers to 1/40 (2.5%) questions, and completely incorrect answers to 0/40 (0%) questions. The genetic counseling category of questions had the highest proportion of answers that were both correct and comprehensive with ChatGPT answering all 20/20 questions with 100% accuracy and were comprehensive in responses. ChatGPT performed equally in the specific genetic disorders category, with 88.2% (15/17) and 66.6% (2/3) correct and comprehensive answers to questions pertaining to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and Lynch syndrome questions respectively. ChatGPT accurately answers questions about genetic syndromes, genetic testing, and counseling in majority of the studied questions. These data suggest this powerful tool can be utilized as a patient resource for genetic counseling questions, though more data input from gynecologic oncologists would be needed to educate patients on genetic syndromes",PubMed
Ocular Pathology and Genetics: Transformative Role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Anterior Segment Diseases,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a revolutionary influence in the field of ophthalmology, providing unparalleled capabilities in data analysis and pattern recognition. This narrative review delves into the crucial role that AI plays, particularly in the context of anterior segment diseases with a genetic basis. Corneal dystrophies (CDs) exhibit significant genetic diversity, manifested by irregular substance deposition in the cornea. AI-driven diagnostic tools exhibit promising accuracy in the identification and classification of corneal diseases. Importantly, chat generative pre-trained transformer (ChatGPT)-4.0 shows significant advancement over its predecessor, ChatGPT-3.5. In the realm of glaucoma, AI significantly contributes to precise diagnostics through inventive algorithms and machine learning models, surpassing conventional methods. The incorporation of AI in predicting glaucoma progression and its role in augmenting diagnostic efficiency is readily apparent. Additionally, AI-powered models prove beneficial for early identification and risk assessment in cases of congenital cataracts, characterized by diverse inheritance patterns. Machine learning models achieving exceptional discrimination in identifying congenital cataracts underscore AI's remarkable potential. The review concludes by emphasizing the promising implications of AI in managing anterior segment diseases, spanning from early detection to the tailoring of personalized treatment strategies. These advancements signal a paradigm shift in ophthalmic care, offering optimism for enhanced patient outcomes and more streamlined healthcare delivery",PubMed
Artificial intelligence in clinical genetics,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been growing more powerful and accessible, and will increasingly impact many areas, including virtually all aspects of medicine and biomedical research. This review focuses on previous, current, and especially emerging applications of AI in clinical genetics. Topics covered include a brief explanation of different general categories of AI, including machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI. After introductory explanations and examples, the review discusses AI in clinical genetics in three main categories: clinical diagnostics; management and therapeutics; clinical support. The review concludes with short, medium, and long-term predictions about the ways that AI may affect the field of clinical genetics. Overall, while the precise speed at which AI will continue to change clinical genetics is unclear, as are the overall ramifications for patients, families, clinicians, researchers, and others, it is likely that AI will result in dramatic evolution in clinical genetics.

Genetic Discovery Enabled by A Large Language Model,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in many areas of medicine, and recently large language models (LLMs) have shown potential utility for clinical applications. However, since we do not know if the use of LLMs can accelerate the pace of genetic discovery, we used data generated from mouse genetic models to investigate this possibility. We examined whether a recently developed specialized LLM (Med-PaLM 2) could analyze sets of candidate genes generated from analysis of murine models of biomedical traits. In response to free-text input, Med-PaLM 2 correctly identified the murine genes that contained experimentally verified causative genetic factors for six biomedical traits, which included susceptibility to diabetes and cataracts. Med-PaLM 2 was also able to analyze a list of genes with high impact alleles, which were identified by comparative analysis of murine genomic sequence data, and it identified a causative murine genetic factor for spontaneous hearing loss. Based upon this Med-PaLM 2 finding, a novel bigenic model for susceptibility to spontaneous hearing loss was developed. These results demonstrate Med-PaLM 2 can analyze gene-phenotype relationships and generate novel hypotheses, which can facilitate genetic discovery","PubMed,biorxiv"
Approximating facial expression effects on diagnostic accuracy via generative AI in medical genetics,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in genomics research and practice, and generative AI has garnered significant recent attention. In clinical applications of generative AI, aspects of the underlying datasets can impact results, and confounders should be studied and mitigated. One example involves the facial expressions of people with genetic conditions. Stereotypically, Williams (WS) and Angelman (AS) syndromes are associated with a ""happy"" demeanor, including a smiling expression. Clinical geneticists may be more likely to identify these conditions in images of smiling individuals. To study the impact of facial expression, we analyzed publicly available facial images of approximately 3500 individuals with genetic conditions. Using a deep learning (DL) image classifier, we found that WS and AS images with non-smiling expressions had significantly lower prediction probabilities for the correct syndrome labels than those with smiling expressions. This was not seen for 22q11.2 deletion and Noonan syndromes, which are not associated with a smiling expression. To further explore the effect of facial expressions, we computationally altered the facial expressions for these images. We trained HyperStyle, a GAN-inversion technique compatible with StyleGAN2, to determine the vector representations of our images. Then, following the concept of InterfaceGAN, we edited these vectors to recreate the original images in a phenotypically accurate way but with a different facial expression. Through online surveys and an eye-tracking experiment, we examined how altered facial expressions affect the performance of human experts. We overall found that facial expression is associated with diagnostic accuracy variably in different genetic conditions",PubMed

"Generative Artificial Intelligence Methods for Pediatric Genetics Education
==========
Generative Methods for Pediatric Genetics Education","Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in an increasing number of areas, with recent interest in generative AI, such as using ChatGPT to generate programming code or DALL-E to make illustrations. We describe the use of generative AI in medical education. Specifically, we sought to determine whether generative AI could help train pediatric residents to better recognize genetic conditions. From publicly available images of individuals with genetic conditions, we used generative AI methods to create new images, which were checked for accuracy with an external classifier. We selected two conditions for study, Kabuki (KS) and Noonan (NS) syndromes, which are clinically important conditions that pediatricians may encounter. In this study, pediatric residents completed 208 surveys, where they each classified 20 images following exposure to one of 4 possible educational interventions, including with and without generative AI methods. Overall, we find that generative images perform similarly but appear to be slightly less helpful than real images. Most participants reported that images were useful, although real images were felt to be more helpful. We conclude that generative AI images may serve as an adjunctive educational tool, particularly for less familiar conditions, such as KS","PubMed,medrxiv"
"ChatGPT in action: Harnessing artificial intelligence potential and addressing ethical challenges in medicine, education, and scientific research","Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like OpenAI's Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), hold considerable potential in healthcare, academia, and diverse industries. Evidence demonstrates its capability at a medical student level in standardized tests, suggesting utility in medical education, radiology reporting, genetics research, data optimization, and drafting repetitive texts such as discharge summaries. Nevertheless, these tools should augment, not supplant, human expertise. Despite promising applications, ChatGPT confronts limitations, including critical thinking tasks and generating false references, necessitating stringent cross-verification. Ensuing concerns, such as potential misuse, bias, blind trust, and privacy, underscore the need for transparency, accountability, and clear policies. Evaluations of AI-generated content and preservation of academic integrity are critical. With responsible use, AI can significantly improve healthcare, academia, and industry without compromising integrity and research quality. For effective and ethical AI deployment, collaboration amongst AI developers, researchers, educators, and policymakers is vital. The development of domain-specific tools, guidelines, regulations, and the facilitation of public dialogue must underpin these endeavors to responsibly harness AI's potential",PubMed
Enhancing personalized gene expression prediction from DNA sequences using genomic foundation models,"Artificial intelligence (AI)/deep learning (DL) models that predict molecular phenotypes like gene expression directly from DNA sequences have recently emerged. While these models have proven effective at capturing the variation across genes, their ability to explain inter-individual differences has been limited. We hypothesize that the performance gap can be narrowed through the use of pre-trained embeddings from the Nucleotide Transformer, a large foundation model trained on 3,000+ genomes. We train a transformer model using the pre-trained embeddings and compare its predictive performance to Enformer, the current state-of-the-art model, using genotype and expression data from 290 individuals. Our model significantly outperforms Enformer in terms of correlation across individuals, and narrows the performance gap with an elastic net regression approach that uses just the genetic variants as predictors. Although simple regression models have their advantages in personalized prediction tasks, DL approaches based on foundation models pre-trained on diverse genomes have unique strengths in flexibility and interpretability. With further methodological and computational improvements with more training data, these models may eventually predict molecular phenotypes from DNA sequences with an accuracy surpassing that of regression-based approaches. Our work demonstrates the potential for large pre-trained AI/DL models to advance functional genomics",PubMed
AI-Powered Neurogenetics: Supporting Patient's Evaluation with Chatbot,"Artificial intelligence and large language models like ChatGPT and Google's Gemini are promising tools with remarkable potential to assist healthcare professionals. This study explores ChatGPT and Gemini's potential utility in assisting clinicians during the first evaluation of patients with suspected neurogenetic disorders. By analyzing the model's performance in identifying relevant clinical features, suggesting differential diagnoses, and providing insights into possible genetic testing, this research seeks to determine whether these AI tools could serve as a valuable adjunct in neurogenetic assessments. Ninety questions were posed to ChatGPT (Versions 4o, 4, and 3.5) and Gemini: four questions about clinical diagnosis, seven about genetic inheritance, estimable recurrence risks, and available tests, and four questions about patient management, each for six different neurogenetic rare disorders (Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia type 4 and type 7, Huntington Disease, Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome, Becker Muscular Dystrophy, and FacioScapuloHumeral Muscular Dystrophy). According to the results of this study, GPT chatbots demonstrated significantly better performance than Gemini. Nonetheless, all AI chatbots showed notable gaps in diagnostic accuracy and a concerning level of hallucinations. As expected, these tools can empower clinicians in assessing neurogenetic disorders, yet their effective use demands meticulous collaboration and oversight from both neurologists and geneticists",PubMed
Enhancing patient representation learning from electronic health records through predicted family relations,"Artificial intelligence and machine learning are powerful tools in analyzing electronic health records (EHRs) for healthcare research. Despite the recognized importance of family health history, in healthcare research individual patients are often treated as independent samples, overlooking family relations. To address this gap, we present ALIGATEHR, which models predicted family relations in a graph attention network and integrates this information with a medical ontology representation. Taking disease risk prediction as a use case, we demonstrate that explicitly modeling family relations significantly improves predictions across the disease spectrum. We then show how ALIGATEHRs attention mechanism, which links patients disease risk to their relatives clinical profiles, successfully captures genetic aspects of diseases using only EHR diagnosis data. Finally, we use ALIGATHER to successfully distinguish the two main inflammatory bowel disease subtypes (Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis), illustrating its great potential for improving patient representation learning for predictive and descriptive modeling of EHRs",medrxiv
Is artificial intelligence getting too much credit in medical genetics?,"Artificial intelligence has lately proven useful in the field of medical genetics. It is already being used to interpret genome sequences and diagnose patients based on facial recognition. More recently, large-language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have been tested for their capacity to provide medical genetics information. It was found that ChatGPT performed similarly to human respondents in factual and critical thinking questions, albeit with reduced accuracy in the latter. In particular, ChatGPT's performance in questions related to calculating the recurrence risk was dismal, despite only having to deal with a single disease. To see if challenging ChatGPT with more difficult problems may reveal its flaws and their bases, it was asked to solve recurrence risk problems dealing with two diseases instead of one. Interestingly, it managed to correctly understand the mode of inheritance of recessive diseases, yet it incorrectly calculated the probability of having a healthy child. Other LLMs were also tested and showed similar noise. This highlights a major limitation for clinical use. While this shortcoming may be solved in the near future, LLMs may not be ready yet to be used as an effective clinical tool in communicating medical genetics information",PubMed
Evaluating ChatGPT as an adjunct for the multidisciplinary tumor board decision-making in primary breast cancer cases,"As the available information about breast cancer is growing every day, the decision-making process for the therapy is getting more complex. ChatGPT as a transformer-based language model possesses the ability to write scientific articles and pass medical exams. But is it able to support the multidisciplinary tumor board (MDT) in the planning of the therapy of patients with breast cancer? We performed a pilot study on 10 consecutive cases of breast cancer patients discussed in MDT at our department in January 2023. Included were patients with a primary diagnosis of early breast cancer. The recommendation of MDT was compared with the recommendation of the ChatGPT for particular patients and the clinical score of the agreement was calculated. Results showed that ChatGPT provided mostly general answers regarding chemotherapy, breast surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and antibody therapy. It was able to identify risk factors for hereditary breast cancer and point out the elderly patient indicated for chemotherapy to evaluate the cost/benefit effect. ChatGPT wrongly identified the patient with Her2 1 + and 2 + (FISH negative) as in need of therapy with an antibody and called endocrine therapy ""hormonal treatment"". Support of artificial intelligence by finding individualized and personalized therapy for our patients in the time of rapidly expanding amount of information is looking for the ways in the clinical routine. ChatGPT has the potential to find its spot in clinical medicine, but the current version is not able to provide specific recommendations for the therapy of patients with primary breast cancer",PubMed
European Projects for Patients with Dementia and Their Caregivers,"As we all know there is no treatment that can stop or delay the progression of dementia. The treatment we use is only symptomatic. EFNS (European Federation of Neurological Societies) recommendations for dementia prevention by Sorbi et al. (2012) concluded that there is no treatment, no lifestyle, which could have an effect on prevention or delay of onset of different forms of dementia until today. The future studies in prevention must recruit younger people, larger sample, and for longer period. The last 10 years we have run, in collaboration with organizations in different European countries, many projects in order to support patients with neurodegenerative diseases, mainly patients with dementia and their caregivers. The first project was a 2-year prospective cohort study of antidementia drug non-persistency in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Europe: predictors of discontinuation and switch in the ICTUS (Impact of Cholinergic Treatment USe) study, an FP5 project with 1380 patients. Five studies were published. The second project was DESCRIPA study, an FP5 project to DEvelopment of Screening guidelines and clinical CRIteria for Predementia Alzheimer's disease, with 881 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). LLM (Long Lasting Memories) and VRADA (A virtual reality application for the exercise of dementia and Alzheimer patients) are two projects that include body and cognitive exercise for health for the elderly and patients with mild cognitive impairment. The next is the RECAGE (REspectful Caring for the AGitated Elderly) project (Horizon 2020), a prospective cohort study for coping with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. With six European universities we finished a very interesting FP6 project, the AddNeuroMed one, which gives even now information about the progression of normal elderly MCI and AD patients, in collaboration with other consortia. A very interesting Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) project about digital biomarkers was entitled Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse-Alzheimer's Disease (RADAR project). The main goal of this project was the development and validation of technology-enabled, quantitative and sensitive measures of functional decline in people with early-stage AD. A running project is an Erasmus+ one in the higher education field, ""Genetic counseling in European universities: The case of neurodegenerative diseases"" (GECONEU project). The target of this study is to develop an online course for university students focusing on genetic counseling, and support people and society to better understand the aims of genetic testing and the usefulness of genetic counseling by involving students in an innovative learning and teaching setting. AD-gaming, BRIDGE, iCONNECT (Intergenerational CONtact between studeNts and people with dEmentia through CreaTive education), E.L.So.M.C.I (English Lessons with the Use of Songs for People with Mild Cognitive Impairment), Games4CoSkills, and De-Sign are all Erasmus+ projects that aim to improve the quality of life of patients with MCI or dementia.

"Guadecitabine plus ipilimumab in unresectable melanoma: five-year follow-up and correlation with integrated, multiomic analysis in the NIBIT-M4 trial","Association of DNA hypomethylating agents (DHA) with immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is a promising strategy to improve efficacy of ICI-based therapy. Here we report the five-year clinical outcome and an integrated multi-omics analysis of pre- and on-treatment lesions from advanced melanoma patients enrolled in the phase Ib NIBIT-M4 study, a dose-escalation trial of the DHA agent guadecitabine combined with ipilimumab. With a minimum follow-up of 45 months the median OS was 25.6 months; the 5-year OS rate was 28.9% and the median DoR was 20.6 months. Specific genomic features and extent of T and B cellmediated immunity discriminated lesions of responding compared to non-responding patients. Enrichment for proliferation and EMT-related gene programs, and immune escape mechanisms characterized lesions from non-responding patients. Integration of a genetic immunoediting index (GIE) with an adaptive immunity signature (ICR) stratified patients/lesions into four distinct subsets and discriminated 5-year OS and PFS. These results suggest that coupling of immunoediting with activation of adaptive immunity is a relevant requisite for achieving long term clinical benefit by epigenetic immunomodulation in advanced melanoma patients",medrxiv
Deriving comprehensive literature trends on multi-omics analysis studies in autism spectrum disorder using literature mining pipeline,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by highly heterogenous abnormalities in functional brain connectivity affecting social behavior. There is a significant progress in understanding the molecular and genetic basis of ASD in the last decade using multi-omics approach. Mining this large volume of biomedical literature for insights requires considerable amount of manual intervention for curation. Machine learning and artificial intelligence fields are advancing toward simplifying data mining from unstructured text data. Here, we demonstrate our literature mining pipeline to accelerate data to insights. Using topic modeling and generative AI techniques, we present a pipeline that can classify scientific literature into thematic clusters and can help in a wide array of applications such as knowledgebase creation, conversational virtual assistant, and summarization. Employing our pipeline, we explored the ASD literature, specifically around multi-omics studies to understand the molecular interplay underlying autism brain",PubMed
Validation of a murine proteome-wide phage display library for the identification of autoantibody specificities,"Autoimmunity is characterized by loss of tolerance to tissue-specific as well as systemic antigens, resulting in complex autoantibody landscapes. Here, we introduce and extensively validate the performance characteristics of a murine proteome-wide library for phage display immunoprecipitation and sequencing (PhIP-seq), to profile mouse autoantibodies. This system and library were validated using seven genetic mouse models across a spectrum of autoreactivity. Mice deficient in antibody production (Rag2-/- and MT) were used to model non-specific peptide enrichments, while cross-reactivity was evaluated using anti-ovalbumin B cell receptor (BCR)-restricted OB1 mice as a proof of principle. The PhIP-seq approach was then utilized to interrogate three distinct autoimmune disease models. First, serum from Lyn-/- IgD+/- mice with lupus-like disease was used to identify nuclear and apoptotic bleb reactivities, lending support to the hypothesis that apoptosis is a shared origin of these antigens. Second, serum from non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a polygenic model of pancreas-specific autoimmunity, enriched peptides derived from both insulin and predicted pancreatic proteins. Lastly, Aire-/- mouse sera were used to identify numerous auto-antigens, many of which were also observed in previous studies of humans with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 1 (APS1) carrying recessive mutations in AIRE. Among these were peptides derived from Perilipin-1, a validated autoimmune biomarker of generalized acquired lipodystrophy in humans. Autoreactivity to Perilipin-1 correlated with lymphocyte infiltration in adipose tissue and underscores the approach in revealing previously unknown specificities. These experiments support the use of murine proteome-wide PhIP-seq for antigenic profiling and autoantibody discovery, which may be employed to study a range of immune perturbations in mouse models of autoimmunity",biorxiv
Tokensome: Towards a Genetic Vision-Language GPT for Explainable and Cognitive Karyotyping,"Automatic karyotype analysis is often defined as a visual perception task focused solely on chromosomal object-level modeling. This definition has led most existing methods to overlook componential and holistic information, significantly constraining model performance. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in current technologies hinders clinical adoption. In this paper, we introduce Tokensome, a novel vision-language model based on chromosome tokenization for explainable and cognitive karyotyping. Tokensome elevates the method from the conventional visual perception layer to the cognitive decision-making layer. This elevation enables the integration of domain knowledge and cognitive reasoning via knowledge graphs and LLMs, markedly enhancing model's explainability and facilitating abnormality detection",arXiv
Dual-task kidney MR segmentation with transformers in autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease,"Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease is a prevalent genetic disorder characterized by the development of renal cysts, leading to kidney enlargement and renal failure. Accurate measurement of total kidney volume through polycystic kidney segmentation is crucial to assess disease severity, predict progression and evaluate treatment effects. Traditional manual segmentation suffers from intra- and inter-expert variability, prompting the exploration of automated approaches. In recent years, convolutional neural networks have been employed for polycystic kidney segmentation from magnetic resonance images. However, the use of Transformer-based models, which have shown remarkable performance in a wide range of computer vision and medical image analysis tasks, remains unexplored in this area. With their self-attention mechanism, Transformers excel in capturing global context information, which is crucial for accurate organ delineations. In this paper, we evaluate and compare various convolutional-based, Transformers-based, and hybrid convolutional/Transformers-based networks for polycystic kidney segmentation. Additionally, we propose a dual-task learning scheme, where a common feature extractor is followed by per-kidney decoders, towards better generalizability and efficiency. We extensively evaluate various architectures and learning schemes on a heterogeneous magnetic resonance imaging dataset collected from 112 patients with polycystic kidney disease. Our results highlight the effectiveness of Transformer-based models for polycystic kidney segmentation and the relevancy of exploiting dual-task learning to improve segmentation accuracy and mitigate data scarcity issues. A promising ability in accurately delineating polycystic kidneys is especially shown in the presence of heterogeneous cyst distributions and adjacent cyst-containing organs. This work contribute to the advancement of reliable delineation methods in nephrology, paving the way for a broad spectrum of clinical applications",PubMed
Suboptimal dietary patterns are associated with accelerated biological aging in young adulthood: a twin study,"Background & aimsSuboptimal diets increase morbidity and mortality risk. Epigenetic clocks are algorithms that can assess health and lifespan, even at a young age, before clinical manifestations of diseases. We investigated the association between dietary patterns and biological aging in young adult twins.  MethodsThe data were drawn from the population-based FinnTwin12 study and consisted of twins aged 21-25 years (n=826). Food and beverage intakes were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Biological aging was estimated using the epigenetic clocks GrimAge and DunedinPACE. Latent class analysis was used to identify dietary patterns. The association between dietary patterns and biological aging was assessed using linear regression modeling at the individual level, followed by within-twin pair analyses to account for genetic liabilities and shared familial confounders.  ResultsSix dietary patterns were identified: 1) High fast food, low fruits and vegetables (F&V), 2) Plant-based, 3) Health-conscious, 4) Western with infrequent fish, 5) Western with regular fish, and 6) Balanced average. At the individual level, GrimAge acceleration was slower in the Plant-based, Health-conscious, and Balanced-average patterns compared to the High fast food, low F&V, and faster in the Western with infrequent fish pattern compared to the Balanced average, regardless of sex, nonalcoholic energy intake, smoking, and alcohol consumption. After further adjustment for BMI and sports participation, the strengths of the associations modestly decreased; however, the difference between the Balanced-average and High fast food, low F&V patterns remained significant. The pace of aging (DunedinPACE) was slower in the Plant-based pattern compared to the High fast food, low F&V and the Western with infrequent fish patterns after adjustment for sex, nonalcoholic energy intake, smoking, and alcohol. The effect sizes were attenuated and reached a non-significant level when BMI and sports participation were added to the model. Most of the associations were replicated in the within-pair analyses among all twin pairs and among dizygotic twin pairs, but the effect sizes tended to be smaller among monozygotic twin pairs. This suggests that genetics, but not a shared environment, may partially explain the observed associations between diet and biological aging.  ConclusionDiets high in fast food, processed red meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages and low in fruits and vegetables are associated with accelerated biological aging in young adulthood. The clustering effect of lifestyle factors and genetic confounders should be considered when interpreting the findings",medrxiv
Multidimensional and Longitudinal Impact of a Genetic Diagnosis for Critically Ill Infants,"Background and ObjectivesMany genetic conditions present in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), where a diagnostic evaluation is pursued. However, understanding of the impact of a genetic diagnosis on clinical outcomes and health-related quality of life for these infants remains incomplete. We therefore evaluated parent-reported outcomes complemented by clinical outcomes measures over one year for a cohort of infants in the NICU undergoing genetic evaluation.  MethodsProspective cohort study evaluating outcomes after genetics consultation in a level IV NICU via parent-report and electronic medical records (EMR) review. Eligible infants were genetically undiagnosed at enrollment. Parent surveys were administered at baseline and three, six-, and 12-months following enrollment and assessed genetic testing utility as well as parent-reported infant health-related quality of life using the Infant Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire.  Results110 infant-parent pairs were enrolled. Infants had a median age at enrollment of 15 days (interquartile range 8-37.75). At baseline, 74% (81/110) of parents endorsed high importance of finding a genetic diagnosis, but perceived importance significantly decreased over time. Over the study period, 38 infants received a molecular diagnosis per parent report, though this was discordant with EMR review. Identification of a diagnosis did not significantly impact health-related quality of life across most domains, which was lower overall than population norms.  ConclusionsA genetic diagnosis is highly desired by parents in the NICU, though waning interest over time for undiagnosed families may reflect parental emotional adaptation and acceptance. Additional supports are needed to improve perceived quality of life",medrxiv
"Preparing to Integrate Generative Pretrained Transformer Series 4 models into Genetic Variant Assessment Workflows: Assessing Performance, Drift, and Nondeterminism Characteristics Relative to Classifying Functional Evidence in Literature","Background. Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise for improving genetic variant literature review in clinical testing. We assessed Generative Pretrained Transformer 4's (GPT-4) performance, nondeterminism, and drift to inform its suitability for use in complex clinical processes. Methods. A 2-prompt process for classification of functional evidence was optimized using a development set of 45 articles. The prompts asked GPT-4 to supply all functional data present in an article related to a variant or indicate that no functional evidence is present. For articles indicated as containing functional evidence, a second prompt asked GPT-4 to classify the evidence into pathogenic, benign, or intermediate/inconclusive categories. A final test set of 72 manually classified articles was used to test performance. Results. Over a 2.5-month period (Dec 2023-Feb 2024), we observed substantial differences in intraday (nondeterminism) and across day (drift) results, which lessened after 1/18/24. This variability is seen within and across models in the GPT-4 series, affecting different performance statistics to different degrees. Twenty runs after 1/18/24 identified articles containing functional evidence with 92.2% sensitivity, 95.6% positive predictive value (PPV) and 86.3% negative predictive value (NPV). The second prompt's identified pathogenic functional evidence with 90.0% sensitivity, 74.0% PPV and 95.3% NVP and for benign evidence with 88.0% sensitivity, 76.6% PPV and 96.9% NVP. Conclusion. Nondeterminism and drift within LLMs must be assessed and monitored when introducing LLM based functionality into clinical workflows. Failing to do this assessment or accounting for these challenges could lead to incorrect or missing information that is critical for patient care. The performance of our prompts appears adequate to assist in article prioritization but not in automated decision making",arXiv
Immunological and molecular study in children with combined immunodeficiency,"Background. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a form of immunodeﬁciencies (PID), caused by molecular defects. These defects can restrict the development and function of lymphocytes. Early diagnosis and treatment of SCID can lead to disease-free survival. This study aims to investigate some of the possible underlying genetic defects in a group of Egyptian infants and children with clinical and immunological profiles suggestive of SCID. Methods. This study included eighty patients who showed clinical warning signs of immunodeficiency. Subjects were thoroughly examined clinically. Laboratory evaluation included immunoglobulins serum levels and flow cytometric assessment of immune cells. This testing showed an altered immune profile in thirty patients. They had decreased T and/or B lymphocytes or natural killer cells. DNA extraction was done for those cases. The coding regions of the RAG1 gene and RAG2 gene was investigated for hot spot mutations by sequencing technique guided by the patient clinical evaluation, inheritance pattern, immunophenotyping by flow cytometric analysis of lymphocyte subsets, and serum immunoglobulins level detection. Results. Results showed novel and previously reported variants (mutation, polymorphism), they were found in 18 cases which include variants in the RAG1 gene (E880K, A960A, H249R, S913R, K820R, V782G), and variants in the RAG2 gene (P501T, L514M, rs10836573, cDNA.2129A>T). Conclusions. To evaluate SCID patients completely, mutation gene analysis is highly required and recommended",PubMed
"Evaluating Computer Vision, Large Language, and Genome-Wide Association Models in a Limited Sized Patient Cohort for Pre-Operative Risk Stratification in Adult Spinal Deformity Surgery","Background: Adult spinal deformities (ASD) are varied spinal abnormalities, often necessitating surgical intervention when associated with pain, worsening deformity, or worsening function. Predicting post-operative complications and revision surgery is critical for surgical planning and patient counseling. Due to the relatively small number of cases of ASD surgery, machine learning applications have been limited to traditional models (e.g., logistic regression or standard neural networks) and coarse clinical variables. We present the novel application of advanced models (CNN, LLM, GWAS) using complex data types (radiographs, clinical notes, genomics) for ASD outcome prediction. Methods: We developed a CNN trained on 209 ASD patients (1549 radiographs) from the Stanford Research Repository, a CNN pre-trained on VinDr-SpineXR (10,468 spine radiographs), and an LLM using free-text clinical notes from the same 209 patients, trained via Gatortron. Additionally, we conducted a GWAS using the UK Biobank, contrasting 540 surgical ASD patients with 7355 non-surgical ASD patients. Results: The LLM notably outperformed the CNN in predicting pulmonary complications (F1: 0.545 vs. 0.2881), neurological complications (F1: 0.250 vs. 0.224), and sepsis (F1: 0.382 vs. 0.132). The pre-trained CNN showed improved sepsis prediction (AUC: 0.638 vs. 0.534) but reduced performance for neurological complication prediction (AUC: 0.545 vs. 0.619). The LLM demonstrated high specificity (0.946) and positive predictive value (0.467) for neurological complications. The GWAS identified 21 significant (p < 10<sup>-5</sup>) SNPs associated with ASD surgery risk (OR: mean: 3.17, SD: 1.92, median: 2.78), with the highest odds ratio (8.06) for the LDB2 gene, which is implicated in ectoderm differentiation. Conclusions: This study exemplifies the innovative application of cutting-edge models to forecast outcomes in ASD, underscoring the utility of complex data in outcome prediction for neurosurgical conditions. It demonstrates the promise of genetic models when identifying surgical risks and supports the integration of complex machine learning tools for informed surgical decision-making in ASD",PubMed
AI-Guided Cancer Therapy for Patients with Coexisting Migraines,"Background: Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Progress in its effective treatment has been hampered by challenges in personalized therapy, particularly in patients with comorbid conditions. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into patient profiling offers a promising approach to enhancing individualized anticancer therapy. Objective: This narrative review explores the role of AI in refining anticancer therapy through personalized profiling, with a specific focus on cancer patients with comorbid migraine. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar.

Key themes were synthesized to provide an overview of recent developments, challenges, and emerging directions. Results: AI technologies, such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP), have become instrumental in the discovery of genetic and molecular biomarkers of cancer and migraine. These technologies also enable predictive analytics for assessing the impact of migraine on cancer therapy in comorbid cases, predicting outcomes and provide clinical decision support systems (CDSS) for real-time treatment adjustments. Conclusions: AI holds significant potential to improve the precision and effectiveness of the management and therapy of cancer patients with comorbid migraine. Nevertheless, challenges remain over data integration, clinical validation, and ethical consideration, which must be addressed to appreciate the full potential for the approach outlined herein",PubMed
DeepGenMon: A Novel Framework for Monkeypox Classification Integrating Lightweight Attention-Based Deep Learning and a Genetic Algorithm,"Background: The rapid global spread of the monkeypox virus has led to serious issues for public health professionals. According to related studies, monkeypox and other types of skin conditions can spread through direct contact with infected animals, humans, or contaminated items. This disease can cause fever, headaches, muscle aches, and enlarged lymph nodes, followed by a rash that develops into lesions. To facilitate the early detection of monkeypox, researchers have proposed several AI-based techniques for accurately classifying and identifying the condition. However, there is still room for improvement to accurately detect and classify monkeypox cases. Furthermore, the currently proposed pre-trained deep learning models can consume extensive resources to achieve accurate detection and classification of monkeypox. Hence, these models often need significant computational power and memory. Methods: This paper proposes a novel lightweight framework called DeepGenMonto accurately classify various types of skin diseases, such as chickenpox, melasma, monkeypox, and others. This suggested framework leverages an attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) and a genetic algorithm (GA) to enhance detection accuracy while optimizing the hyperparameters of the proposed model. It first applies the attention mechanism to highlight and assign weights to specific regions of an image that are relevant to the model's decision-making process. Next, the CNN is employed to process the visual input and extract hierarchical features for classifying the input data into multiple classes. Finally, the CNN's hyperparameters are adjusted using a genetic algorithm to enhance the model's robustness and classification accuracy. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, DeepGenMon features a lightweight design that requires significantly lower computational resources and is easier to train with few parameters. Its effective integration of a CNN and an attention mechanism with a GA further enhances its performance, making it particularly well suited for low-resource environments. DeepGenMon is evaluated on two public datasets. The first dataset comprises 847 images of diverse skin diseases, while the second dataset contains 659 images classified into several categories. Results: The proposed model demonstrates superior performance compared to SOTA models across key evaluation metrics. On dataset 1, it achieves a precision of 0.985, recall of 0.984, F-score of 0.985, and accuracy of 0.985. Similarly, on dataset 2, the model attains a precision of 0.981, recall of 0.982, F-score of 0.982, and accuracy of 0.982. Moreover, the findings demonstrate the model's ability to achieve an inference time of 2.9764 s on dataset 1 and 2.1753 s on dataset 2. Conclusions: These results also show DeepGenMon's effectiveness in accurately classifying different skin conditions, highlighting its potential as a reliable and low-resource tool in clinical settings",PubMed
Critical assessment of variant prioritization methods for rare disease diagnosis within the Rare Genomes Project,"BackgroundA major obstacle faced by rare disease families is obtaining a genetic diagnosis. The average ""diagnostic odyssey"" lasts over five years, and causal variants are identified in under 50%. The Rare Genomes Project (RGP) is a direct-to-participant research study on the utility of genome sequencing (GS) for diagnosis and gene discovery. Families are consented for sharing of sequence and phenotype data with researchers, allowing development of a Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI) community challenge, placing variant prioritization models head-to-head in a real-life clinical diagnostic setting.  MethodsPredictors were provided a dataset of phenotype terms and variant calls from GS of 175 RGP individuals (65 families), including 35 solved training set families, with causal variants specified, and 30 test set families (14 solved, 16 unsolved). The challenge tasked teams with identifying the causal variants in as many test set families as possible. Ranked variant predictions were submitted with estimated probability of causal relationship (EPCR) values. Model performance was determined by two metrics, a weighted score based on rank position of true positive causal variants and maximum F-measure, based on precision and recall of causal variants across EPCR thresholds.  ResultsSixteen teams submitted predictions from 52 models, some with manual review incorporated. Top performing teams recalled the causal variants in up to 13 of 14 solved families by prioritizing high quality variant calls that were rare, predicted deleterious, segregating correctly, and consistent with reported phenotype. In unsolved families, newly discovered diagnostic variants were returned to two families following confirmatory RNA sequencing, and two prioritized novel disease gene candidates were entered into Matchmaker Exchange. In one example, RNA sequencing demonstrated aberrant splicing due to a deep intronic indel in ASNS, identified in trans with a frameshift variant, in an unsolved proband with phenotype overlap with asparagine synthetase deficiency.  ConclusionsBy objective assessment of variant predictions, we provide insights into current state-of-the-art algorithms and platforms for genome sequencing analysis for rare disease diagnosis and explore areas for future optimization. Identification of diagnostic variants in unsolved families promotes synergy between researchers with clinical and computational expertise as a means of advancing the field of clinical genome interpretation",medrxiv
"A graphSAGE discovers synergistic combinations of Gefitinib, paclitaxel, and Icotinib for Lung adenocarcinoma management by targeting human genes and proteins: the RAIN protocol","BackgroundAdenocarcinoma of the lung is the most common type of lung cancer, and it is characterized by distinct cellular and molecular features. It occurs when abnormal lung cells multiply out of control and form a tumor in the outer region of the lungs. Adenocarcinoma of the lung is a serious and life-threatening condition that requires effective and timely management to improve the survival and quality of life of the patients. One of the challenges in this cancer treatment is finding the optimal combination of drugs that can target the genes or proteins that are involved in the disease process.  MethodIn this article, we propose a novel method to recommend combinations of trending drugs to target its associated proteins/genes, using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) under the RAIN protocol. The RAIN protocol is a three-step framework that consists of: 1) Applying graph neural networks to recommend drug combinations by passing messages between trending drugs for managing disease and genes that act as potential targets for disease; 2) Retrieving relevant articles with clinical trials that include those proposed drugs in previous step using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The search queries include ""Adenocarcinoma of the lung"", ""Gefitinib"", ""Paclitaxel"", ""Icotinib"" that searched context based in databases using NLP; 3) Analyzing the network meta-analysis to measure the comparative efficacy of the drug combinations.  ResultWe applied our method to a dataset of nodes and edges that represent the network, where each node is a drug or a gene, and each edge is a p-value between them. We found that the graph neural network recommends combining Gefitinib, Paclitaxel, and Icotinib as the most effective drug combination to target this cancer associated proteins/genes. We reviewed the clinical trials and expert opinions on these medications and found that they support our claim. The network meta-analysis also confirmed the effectiveness of these drugs on associated genes.  ConclusionOur method is a novel and promising approach to recommend trending drugs combination to target cancer associated proteins/genes, using graph neural networks under the RAIN protocol. It can help clinicians and researchers to find the best treatment options for patients, and also provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of the disease.

"Within-subject changes in DNA-methylome profile identify individual signatures of early-life adversity, with a potential to predict neuropsychiatric outcome","BackgroundAdverse early-life experiences (ELA), including poverty, trauma and neglect, affect a majority of the worlds children. Whereas the impact of ELA on cognitive and emotional health throughout the lifespan is well-established, it is not clear how distinct types of ELA influence child development, and there are no tools to predict for an individual child their vulnerability or resilience to the consequences of ELAs. Epigenetic markers including DNA-methylation profiles of peripheral cells may encode ELA and provide a predictive outcome marker. However, the rapid dynamic changes in DNA methylation in childhood and the inter-individual variance of the human genome pose barriers to identifying profiles predicting outcomes of ELA exposure. Here, we examined the relation of several dimensions of ELA to changes of DNA methylation, using a longitudinal within-subject design and a high threshold for methylation changes in the hope of mitigating the above challenges.  MethodsWe analyzed DNA methylation in buccal swab samples collected twice for each of 110 infants: neonatally and at 12 months. We identified CpGs differentially methylated across time, calculated methylation changes for each child, and determined whether several indicators of ELA associated with changes of DNA methylation for individual infants. We then correlated select dimensions of ELA with methylation changes as well as with measures of executive function at age 5 years. We examined for sex differences, and derived a sex-dependent  impact score based on sites that most contributed to the methylation changes.  FindingsSetting a high threshold for methylation changes, we discovered that changes in methylation between two samples of an individual child reflected age-related trends towards augmented methylation, and also correlated with executive function years later. Among the tested factors and ELA dimensions, including income to needs ratios, maternal sensitivity, body mass index and sex, unpredictability of parental and household signals was the strongest predictor of executive function. In girls, an interaction was observed between a measure of high early-life unpredictability and methylation changes, in presaging executive function.  InterpretationThese findings establish longitudinal, within-subject changes in methylation profiles as a signature of some types of ELA in an individual child. Notably, such changes are detectable beyond the age-associated DNA methylation dynamics. Future studies are required to determine if the methylation profile changes identified here provide a predictive marker of vulnerabilities to poorer cognitive and emotional outcomes.  FundingSupported by NIH P50 MH096889, a Precision Medicine Initiative grant from the State of California (OPR20141) and the Bren Foundation.  Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIdentification of individuals at risk for cognitive and emotional problems is required for targeted interventions. At the population level, experiencing early-life adversity has been consistently linked to an elevated susceptibility to various mental illnesses. However, recent studies have revealed a significant limitation in the ability of early-life adversity to predict individual-level risk, and there is presently no reliable tool available to determine whether a child experiencing adversity will develop future mental health problems. Promising efforts to discover predictive markers by examining DNA methylation in peripheral cells are challenged by extensive genetic and epigenetic population variability and the rapid methylation changes taking place during childhood, rendering the identification of clinically valuable predictive markers a complex endeavor.  Added value of this studyThis study examined neurodevelopmental outcomes following several dimensions of ELA, including a recently identified dimension-unpredictability of parental and environmental signals to the child. It demonstrates changes in DNA methylation in children exposed to a spectrum of ELA dimensions and severity using alternative approaches to those used previously: It employs a longitudinal within-subject design, enabling assessment of DNA changes within an individual over time rather than a cross section comparison of different groups, and focuses on the first year of life, an understudied epoch of development. The study uses reduced representation bisulfite sequencing to measure methylation, an approach compromising between targeted sequencing and a whole genome approach, and sets a high threshold for methylation changes, in consideration of the large changes of DNA methylation during childhood. Finally, in accord with emerging discoveries of the differential effects of ELA on males and females, the study uncovers sex-effects arising already before puberty.  Implications of all the available evidenceCollectively, our study, together with a robust existing literature (1) identifies early-life unpredictability as an additional determinant of DNA methylation changes, (2) indicates that within-subject changes in methylation profiles of peripheral cells hold promise as precision medicine tools for predicting risk and resilience to the adverse consequences of early-life hardships on mental health, and (3) suggests that sex-differences should be explored even prior to puberty. Our study contributes significantly to the important goal of early identification of predictive ""epigenetic scars"" caused by adverse early-life experiences. Such markers are required for targeting interventions to those most at need",biorxiv
Evaluation of false positive and false negative errors in targeted next generation sequencing,"BackgroundAlthough next generation sequencing (NGS) has been adopted as an essential diagnostic tool in various diseases, NGS errors have been the most serious problem in clinical implementation. Especially in cancers, low level mutations have not been easy to analyze, due to the contaminating normal cells and tumor heterozygosity.  ResultsIn targeted NGS (T-NGS) analyses for reference-standard samples containing mixtures of homozygote H. mole DNA with blood genomic DNA at various ratios from four certified NGS service providers, large differences in the lower detection limit of variants (16.3 times, 1.51[~]24.66%) and the false positive (FP) error rate (4280 times, 5.814 x 10-4 [~]1.359 x 10-7) were found. Employment of the commercially available Dragen system for bioinformatic analyses reduced FP errors in the results from companies BB and CC, but the errors originating from the NGS raw data persisted. Bioinformatic conditional adjustment to increase sensitivity (less than 2 times) led to a much higher FP error rate (610[~]8200 times). In addition, problems such as biased preferential reference base calls during bioinformatic analysis and high-rate FN errors in HLA regions were found in the NGS analysis.  ConclusionT-NGS results from certified NGS service providers can be quite various in their sensitivity and FP error rate, suggesting the necessity of further quality controls for clinical implementation of T-NGS. The present study also suggests that mixtures of homozygote and heterozygote DNAs can be easily employed as excellent reference-standard materials for quality control of T-NGS",biorxiv
"Prediction, prognosis and monitoring of neurodegeneration at biobank-scale via machine learning and imaging","BackgroundAlzheimers disease and related dementias (ADRD) and Parkinsons disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative conditions. These central nervous system disorders impact both the structure and function of the brain and may lead to imaging changes that precede symptoms. Patients with ADRD or PD have long asymptomatic phases that exhibit significant heterogeneity. Hence, quantitative measures that can provide early disease indicators are necessary to improve patient stratification, clinical care, and clinical trial design. This work uses machine learning techniques to derive such a quantitative marker from T1-weighted (T1w) brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  MethodsIn this retrospective study, we developed machine learning (ML) based disease-specific scores based on T1w brain MRI utilizing Parkinsons Disease Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts. We evaluated the potential of ML-based scores for early diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of ADRD and PD in an independent large-scale population-based longitudinal cohort, UK Biobank.  Findings1,826 dementia images from 731 participants, 3,161 healthy control images from 925 participants from the ADNI cohort, 684 PD images from 319 participants, and 232 healthy control images from 145 participants from the PPMI cohort were used to train machine learning models. The classification performance is 0.94 [95% CI: 0.93-0.96] area under the ROC Curve (AUC) for ADRD detection and 0.63 [95% CI: 0.57-0.71] for PD detection using 790 extracted structural brain features. The most predictive regions include the hippocampus and temporal brain regions in ADRD and the substantia nigra in PD. The normalized ML models probabilistic output (ADRD and PD imaging scores) was evaluated on 42,835 participants with imaging data from the UK Biobank. There are 66 cases for ADRD and 40 PD cases whose T1 brain MRI is available during pre-diagnostic phases. For diagnosis occurrence events within 5 years, the integrated survival model achieves a time-dependent AUC of 0.86 [95% CI: 0.80-0.92] for dementia and 0.89 [95% CI: 0.85-0.94] for PD. ADRD imaging score is strongly associated with dementia-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) 1.76 [95% CI: 1.50-2.05] per S.D. of imaging score), and PD imaging score shows association with PD-free survival (hazard ratio 2.33 [95% CI: 1.55-3.50]) in our integrated model. HR and prevalence increased stepwise over imaging score quartiles for PD, demonstrating heterogeneity. As a proxy for diagnosis, we validated AD/PD polygenic risk scores of 42,835 subjects against the imaging scores, showing a highly significant association after adjusting for covariates. In both the PPMI and ADNI cohorts, the scores are associated with clinical assessments, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and pathological markers, which include amyloid and tau. Finally, imaging scores are associated with polygenic risk scores for multiple diseases. Our results suggest that we can use imaging scores to assess the genetic architecture of such disorders in the future.  InterpretationOur study demonstrates the use of quantitative markers generated using machine learning techniques for ADRD and PD. We show that disease probability scores obtained from brain structural features are useful for early detection, prognosis prediction, and monitoring disease progression. To facilitate community engagement and external tests of model utility, an interactive app to explore summary level data from this study and dive into external data can be found here https://ndds-brainimaging-ml.streamlit.app. As far as we know, this is the first publicly available cloud-based MRI prediction application.  FundingUS National Institute on Aging, and US National Institutes of Health.  Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for articles published in English from database inception to May 11, 2023, about the use of machine learning on brain imaging data for Alzheimers disease (AD), dementia, and Parkinsons disease (PD) populations. We used search terms ""machine learning"" AND ""brain imaging"" AND ""neurodegenerative disorders"" AND ""quantitative biomarkers"". The search identified 25 studies. Most of these studies are focused on Alzheimers disease. They use machine learning to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia or to build a classification tool. Many studies also focused on positron emission tomography (PET) images rather than cost-effective T1w MRI images in their analysis. None of the studies have focused on detecting disease during the asymptomatic phase of dementia and PD. Identified studies are limited in sample size (order of hundred samples) and extracted features. The assessments of the clinical utility of machine learning models predicted disease probabilities are scarce. Significantly, no attempts were made to validate the algorithm in an external cohort. In this work, we have limited our review to scientific studies that are transparent and reproducible, including those that provide code and validate their findings on a reasonable sample size.  Added value of this studyThis study developed machine learning based quantitative scores to measure the risk, severity, and prognosis of Alzheimers disease and related dementias (ADRD) and Parkinsons disease (PD) using brain imaging data. Neurodegenerative disorders affect multiple body functions and exhibit significant etiology and clinical presentation variation. Patients with these conditions may experience prolonged asymptomatic periods. Disease-modifying therapies are most effective during the early asymptomatic stage of the disease, making early intervention a crucial factor. However, the lack of biomarkers for early diagnosis and disease progression monitoring remains a significant obstacle to achieving this goal. We leveraged disease-specific cohorts ADNI (1,826 images from 731 dementia participants) and PPMI (684 images from 329 PD participants) to develop a machine learning classifier for AD and PD detection using T1w brain imaging data. We obtain disease-specific imaging scores from these trained models using the normalized disease probability score. In a sizable external biobank, UK Biobank (42,835 participants), we found these scores show strong predictive power in determining the occurrence of PD or dementia during a 5-year followup. The occurrence of PD increased stepwise over ascending imaging score quantiles representing heterogeneity within the PD population. Imaging scores are also associated with pathological and clinical assessment measures. Our study indicates this could be a single numeric indicator representing disease-specific abnormality in T1w brain imaging modality. The association of imaging scores with the polygenic risk score of related disorders implies the genetic basis of these scores. We also identified top brain regions associated with dementia and Parkinsons disease using feature interpretation tools.  Implications of all the available evidenceThe findings should improve our ability to create practical passive surveillance plans for individuals with a heightened risk of occurrence of neurodegenerative disease. We have shown that imaging scores complement other risk factors, such as age and polygenic risk scores for early detection. The integrated model could serve as a tool for early interventions and study enrollment. Understanding the genetic basis of imaging scores can provide valuable insights into the biology of neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, these high-accuracy models able to facilitate accurate early detection at the biobank scale can empower precision medicine trial recruitment strategies as well as paths of care for the future. We have included the development of an interactive web server (https://ndds-brainimaging-ml.streamlit.app) that empowers the community to process their own data based on our models and explore the utility and applicability of these findings for themselves. Users can easily upload a Nifti or DICOM file containing their MRI image, and we handle the entire pre-processing and prediction process. All computations are performed on the Google Cloud Platform. In addition, we provide an interpretation of the ML prediction highlighting areas of the brain that have contributed to the decision and a what-if-analysis tool where users explore different scenarios and their effect on prediction",medrxiv
Associations between DNA methylation and cognitive function in early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients,"BackgroundApproximately one-third of breast cancer (BC) patients show poorer cognitive function (CF) before receiving adjuvant therapy compared with age-matched healthy controls. However, the biological mechanisms driving CF variation in the context of BC remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify genes and biological pathways associated with CF in postmenopausal women with early-stage hormone receptor-positive (HR+) BC using DNA methylation (DNAm) data, a dynamic regulator of gene activity.  MethodsEpigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and differentially methylated region analyses were performed for each CF phenotype (seven objective domains and one subjective phenotype) using DNAm data from whole blood samples (n=109) taken at time of enrollment. Post-EWAS functional analyses were performed to enhance the understanding of the CF-related cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites.  ResultsWhen adjusting for age, verbal IQ scores, and global DNAm signature, cg10331779 near CTNND2 (p-value= 9.65 x 10-9) and cg25906741 in MLIP (p-value= 2.01 x 10-8) were associated with processing speed and subjective CF, respectively, while regions in/near SLC6A11, PRKG1/CSTF2T, and FAM3B for processing speed, and regions in/near PI4KB and SGCE/PEG10 for mental flexibility were differentially methylated. In addition, beta-estradiol was identified as a common upstream regulator for all the CF phenotypes, suggesting an essential role of estrogen in explaining variation in CF of HR+ BC patients.  ConclusionsIn our EWAS of 8 CF phenotypes, we found two epigenome-wide significant signals, one at cg10331779 near CTNND2 with processing speed and the other at cg25906741 in MLIP with subjective CF. We also found three differentially methylated regions associated with processing speed and two associated with mental flexibility. These findings need replication in larger cohorts",medrxiv
"The clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic landscape of BRAF mutant cancers","BackgroundBRAF mutations are classified into 4 molecularly distinct groups, and Class 1 (V600) mutant tumors are treated with targeted therapies. Effective treatment has not been established for Class 2/3 or BRAF Fusions. We investigated whether BRAF mutation class differed according to clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic variables in cancer patients.  MethodsUsing the AACR GENIE (v.12) cancer database, the distribution of BRAF mutation class in adult cancer patients was analyzed according to sex, age, primary race, and tumor type. Genomic alteration data and transcriptomic analysis was performed using The Cancer Genome Atlas.  ResultsBRAF mutations were identified in 9515 (6.2%) samples among 153,834, with melanoma (31%), CRC (20.7%), and NSCLC (13.9%) being the most frequent cancer types. Class 1 harbored co-mutations outside of the MAPK pathway (TERT, RFN43) vs Class 2/3 mutations (RAS, NF1). Across all tumour types, Class 2/3 were enriched for alterations in genes involved in UV response and WNT/{beta}-catenin. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of WNT/{beta}-catenin and Hedgehog signaling in non-V600 mutated CRC. Males had a higher proportion of Class 3 mutations vs. females (17.4% vs 12.3% q = 0.003). Non-V600 mutations were generally more common in older patients (aged 60+) vs younger (38% vs 15% p<0.0001), except in CRC (15% vs 30% q = 0.0001). Black race was associated with non-V600 BRAF alterations (OR: 1.58; p<0.0001).  ConclusionsClass 2/3 BRAF are more present in Black, male patients with co-mutations outside of the MAPK pathway, likely requiring additional oncogenic input for tumorigenesis. Improving access to NGS and trial enrollment will help development of targeted therapies for non-V600 BRAF mutations.  Statement of Translational RelevanceBRAF mutations are classified in 4 categories based on molecular characteristics, but only Class 1 BRAF V600 have effective targeted treatment strategies. With increasing access to next-generation sequencing, oncologists are more frequently uncovering non-V600 BRAF mutations, where there remains a scarcity of effective therapies. Responsiveness to MAPK pathway inhibitors differs according to BRAF mutation class and primary tumor type. For this reason, we sought to determine whether key demographic, genomic, and transcriptomic differences existed between classes. This cross-sectional study analyzes the largest dataset of BRAF-mutated cancers to date. Our findings propose insights to optimize clinical trial design and patient selection in the pursuit of developing effective treatment strategies for patients whose tumors harbor non-V600 BRAF mutations. This study also offers insights into the potential of targeting alternative pathways in addition to the MAPK pathway as part of combinatorial treatment strategies",biorxiv
Conventional therapy induces tumor immunoediting and modulates the immune contexture in colorectal cancer,"BackgroundCancer immunotherapies for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) continue to lag behind other solid cancer types with the exception of 4% of patients with microsatellite-instable tumors. Thus, there is an urgent need to broaden the clinical benefit of checkpoint blockers to CRC by combining conventional therapies to sensitise tumors to immunotherapy. However, the impact of conventional drugs on immunoediting, potentially promoting the positive selection of less immunogenic variants, and on the tumor immune contexture in CRC, remain elusive.  MethodsWe performed comprehensive multimodal profiling using longitudinal samples from metastatic CRC patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy with mFOLFOX6 and Bevacizumab. Exome-sequencing, RNA-sequencing and multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging was carried out on tumor samples obtained before and after therapy and the data was analysed using established methods. The results of the analysis were extrapolated to publicly available datasets (TCGA and CPTAC). In order to identify a surrogate marker, an explainable artificial intelligence method was developed using a transformer-based analytical pipeline for the identification of features in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) images associated with specific biological processes, followed by manual evaluation of highly informative tiles by a pathologist.  ResultsMutational profiles were highly modified and the level of genetic intertumoral heterogeneity between patients varied following treatment. Evolutionary analysis indicated eradication of some clones and dominant clonal prevalence of others, supporting the notion of pharmacologically-induced cancer immunoeditin. Post treatment samples showed upregulation of HLA class II genes, activation of differentiation and stemness pathways, and changes in the consensus molecular subtypes. The tumor immune contexture was characterised by increased densities of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, but reduced T cell-tumor cell interactions (and increased T cell exhaustion. The AI-guided analyses of the H&E images pinpointed extracellular mucin deposits associated with stemness genes, suggesting a surrogate marker for routine pathological evaluation.  ConclusionsConventional therapy induces immunoediting and modulates the immune contexture in metastatic CRC patients",biorxiv
"Genetic ancestry superpopulations show distinct prevalence and outcomes across pediatric central nervous system tumors from the PBTA and PNOC
==========
Genetic ancestry superpopulations show distinct prevalence and outcomes across pediatric central nervous system tumors","BackgroundCentral nervous system (CNS) tumors lead to cancer-related mortality in children. Genetic ancestry-associated cancer prevalence and outcomes have been studied, but is limited.  MethodsWe performed genetic ancestry prediction in 1,454 pediatric patients with paired normal and tumor whole genome sequencing from the Open Pediatric Cancer (OpenPedCan) project to evaluate the influence of reported race and ethnicity and ancestry-based genetic superpopulations on tumor histology, molecular subtype, survival, and treatment.  ResultsPredicted superpopulations included African (AFR, N=153), Admixed American (AMR, N=223), East Asian (EAS, N=67), European (EUR, N=968), and South Asian (SAS, N=43). Reported race and ethnicity and ancestry-based genetic superpopulations were non-randomly associated. Patients with an atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor or meningioma were enriched for AFR ancestry. Patients of AMR ancestry with KIAA1549::BRAF fusion-positive low-grade glioma (LGG) had tumors enriched for rare fusion breakpoints, lesser extent of surgical resection, and worse event-free survival (EFS). Non-EUR and AMR patients with germ cell tumors or SHH- activated medulloblastoma exhibited worse EFS relative to EUR patients, and patients of AFR ancestry with LGG or ependymoma had worse overall survival compared to EUR patients. We observed higher frequency of clinical trial enrollment among AMR patients across tumor histologies, but increased utilization of photon versus proton radiation relative to other superpopulations.  ConclusionsGenetic ancestry-associated differences exist across pediatric CNS tumor histological and molecular subtypes. Further investigation into genetic and socioeconomic factors contributing to these observed inequities is needed.  Key PointsDistinct associations of genetic ancestry-based superpopulations exist within pediatric CNS tumor histologic and molecular subtypes and correlate with survival outcomes and treatment.  Importance of the StudyThis work provides critical insight on the impact of reported race and ethnicity and genetic-based ancestry superpopulations on nearly 1,500 pediatric patients with CNS tumors who had matched normal and tumor sequencing performed. We identify novel associations between ancestry superpopulations and tumor histology, molecular subtypes, and treatments received. Here, we begin to inform on the contributions of social constructs of race and ethnicity and tumor characteristics that are enriched among genetic-based ancestry superpopulations on clinical outcomes of pediatric patients with CNS tumors. Our findings indicate that potential social and genetic risk stratifications exist for pediatric CNS tumors and warrant further investigation to ensure equitable clinical outcomes for all patients",medrxiv
"Copy number variation analysis of 9,482 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates identifies lineage-specific molecular determinants","BackgroundClinical manifestations of tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) show lineage-specific differences contributed by genetic polymorphism such as phylo-single nucleotide variations (PhyloSNPs) and insertion or deletions (INDELs). Intragenomic rearrangement events, such as gene duplications and deletions, may cause gene copy number differences in Mtb, contributing to lineage-specific phenotypic variations, if any, which need better understanding.  ResultsThe relative gene copy number differences in high-quality publicly available whole genome sequencing datasets of 9,482 clinical Mtb isolates were determined by repurposing and modifying an RNA-seq data analysis pipeline. The pipeline included various steps, viz., alignment of reads, sorting by coordinate, GC bias correction, and variant stabilising transformation. The strategy showed maximum separation of lineage-specific clusters in two principal components, capturing [~]54% variability. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the top 100 genes and pairwise comparisons between Mtb lineages revealed an overlapping subset of genes (n=42) having significantly perturbed copy numbers (Benjamin Hochberg adjusted P-value < 0.05 and log2(drug-resistant/sensitive) > {+/-} 1). These 42 genes formed multiple tandem gene clusters and are known to be involved in virulence, pathogenicity and defence response to invading phages. A separate comparison showed a significantly high copy number of phage genes and a recently reported druggable target Rv1525 in pre- and extensively drug-resistant (Pre-XDR, XDR) compared to drug-sensitive clinical Mtb isolates.  ConclusionThe identified gene sets in Mtb clinical isolates may be useful targets for lineage-specific therapeutics and diagnostics development",biorxiv
Fine-tuned large language models for answering questions about full-text biomedical research studies,"BackgroundFew studies have explored the degree to which fine-tuning a large-language model (LLM) can improve its ability to answer a specific set of questions about a research study.  MethodsWe created an instruction set comprising 250 marked-down studies of HIV drug resistance, 16 questions per study, answers to each question, and explanations for each answer. The questions were broadly relevant to studies of pathogenic human viruses including whether a study reported viral genetic sequences and the demographics and antiviral treatments of the persons from whom sequences were obtained. We fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini (GPT-4o), Llama3.1-8B-Instruct (Llama3.1-8B), and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct (Llama3.1-70B) using a quantized low rank adapter (QLoRA). We assessed the accuracy, precision, and recall of each base and fine-tuned model in answering the same questions on a test set comprising 120 different studies. Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare base models to one another, fine-tuned models to their respective base model, and the fine-tuned models to one another.  ResultsPrior to fine-tuning, GPT-4o displayed significantly greater performance than both Llama3.1-70B and Llama3.1-8B due to its greater precision compared with Llama3.1-70B and greater precision and recall compared with Llama3.1-8B; there was no difference in performance between Llama3.1-70B and Llama3.1-8B. After fine-tuning, both GPT-4o and Llama3.1-70B, but not Llama3.1-8B, displayed significantly improved performance compared with their base models. The improved performance of GPT-4o resulted from a mean 6% increased precision and 9% increased recall; the improved performance of Llama3.1-70B resulted from a 15% increased precision. After fine-tuning, Llama3.1-70B significantly outperformed Llama3.1-8B but did not perform as well as the fine-tuned GPT-4o model which displayed superior recall.  ConclusionFine-tuning GPT-4o and Llama3.1-70B, but not the smaller Llama3.1-8B, led to marked improvement in answering specific questions about research papers. The process we describe will be useful to researchers studying other medical domains.  AUTHOR SUMMARYAddressing key biomedical questions often requires systematically reviewing data from numerous studies--a process that demands time and expertise. Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in screening papers and summarizing their content. However, few research groups have fine-tuned these models to enhance their performance in specialized biomedical domains. In this study, we fine-tuned three LLMs to answer questions about studies on the subject of HIV drug resistance including one proprietary LLM (GPT-4o-mini) and two open-source LLMs (Llama3.1-Instruct-70B and Llama 3.1-Instruct-8B). To fine-tune the models, we used an instruction set comprising 250 studies of HIV drug resistance and selected 16 questions covering whether studies included viral genetic sequences, patient demographics, and antiviral treatments. We then tested the models on 120 independent research studies. Our results showed that fine-tuning GPT-4o-mini and Llama3.1-Instruct-70B significantly improved their ability to answer domain-specific questions, while the smaller Llama3.1-Instruct-8B model was not improved. The process we described offers a roadmap for researchers in other fields and represents a step in our attempt towards developing an LLM capable of answering questions about research studies across a range of pathogenic human viruses",medrxiv
Evaluating GPT-4-based ChatGPT's Clinical Potential on the NEJM Quiz,"BackgroundGPT-4-based ChatGPT demonstrates significant potential in various industries; however, its potential clinical applications remain largely unexplored.  MethodsWe employed the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) quiz ""Image Challenge"" from October 2021 to March 2023 to assess ChatGPTs clinical capabilities. The quiz, designed for healthcare professionals, tests the ability to analyze clinical scenarios and make appropriate decisions. We evaluated ChatGPTs performance on the NEJM quiz, analyzing its accuracy rate by questioning type and specialty after excluding quizzes which were impossible to answer without images. The NEJM quiz has five multiple-choice options, but ChatGPT was first asked to answer without choices, and then given the choices to answer afterwards, in order to evaluate the accuracy in both scenarios.  ResultsChatGPT achieved an 87% accuracy without choices and a 97% accuracy with choices, after excluding 16 image-based quizzes. Upon analyzing performance by quiz type, ChatGPT excelled in the Diagnosis category, attaining 89% accuracy without choices and 98% with choices. Although other categories featured fewer cases, ChatGPTs performance remained consistent. It demonstrated strong performance across the majority of medical specialties; however, Genetics had the lowest accuracy at 67%.  ConclusionChatGPT demonstrates potential for clinical application, suggesting its usefulness in supporting healthcare professionals and enhancing AI-driven healthcare",medrxiv
Alternative mRNA Splicing and Polyadenylation Events are Synchronous with Podocyte Injury and Slit Diaphragm Dysregulation in Glomerular Disease Models,"BackgroundGlomerular disease, often characterized by podocyte injury and proteinuria, can lead to chronic kidney disease and end stage kidney disease. We hypothesized that the glomerular pathophysiology is associated with alternative mRNA processing, such as alternative splicing (AS) and polyadenylation (APA), of glomerular genes and especially of critical podocyte, slit diaphragm and matrix genes that regulate the glomerular filtration barrier.  MethodsGlomerular damage, accompanied with proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and hypercholesterolemia was induced by puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) or adriamycin (ADR) to mimic human minimal change disease (MCD) or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), respectively. Glomerular RNA-seq analyses was performed followed by JunctionSeq and APATrap bioinformatics analyses to detect AS and APA events, respectively. Novel splice sites and poly(A) usage sites and differences in alternatively spliced and polyadenylated isoforms were queried in JunctionSeq and APATrap pipelines.  ResultsAltered glomerular mRNA processing by AS/APA was identified in 136/71 and 1875/746 genes in MCD and FSGS models, respectively. Transcript annotation and prioritization of significant AS and APA identified key events in genes with novel and established roles that cause disruption in the glomerular filtration barrier. These events localized in the regions of slit diaphragm (NPHS1, NPHS2, NEPH1, ZO1, ITM2B), glomerular basement membrane (COL4A3/4/5, LAMB2, LAMA5), podocyte mitochondria (COQ2), podocyte membrane (PODXL) and endothelial cells (INF2). Concomitantly, numerous polyadenylation and splicing factors which could serve as potential trans-factors that lead to AS and APA, were dysregulated in these two models of glomerular nephropathies. Additionally, beneficial proteinuria reducing treatment modalities, pioglitazone and GQ16 reversed many of these AS and APA events. Moreover, suggestive GWAS SNPs were identified in many of these genes from human nephrotic syndrome database, which could potentially serve as cis-factors that lead to AS and APA, and downstream functional effects.  ConclusionFindings from our studies shed light on a new landscape of research in glomerular pathophysiology, i.e., AS and APA of glomerular genes, many of which are crucial determinants of podocyte structure and function, slit diaphragm complex, and glomerular basement membrane. These findings present new implications for improved mechanistic understanding of glomerular disease and development of novel therapeutic intervention strategies.  Significance StatementRNA biology is complex, and while alternative mRNA processing events, such as alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) have been shown to play important roles in physiology, development, and diseases like cancer; there is very limited knowledge of their roles in glomerular disease. Various forms of glomerular disease can unfortunately be frequently refractory to current immunosuppressive or anti-hypertensive treatments, leading to progression to chronic kidney disease and end stage kidney disease, ultimately requiring dialysis and transplant. In the current study, we identified alternative mRNA processing events of global glomerular mRNAs due to AS and APA during podocyte and glomerular injury, using two distinct animal models of glomerular disease, minimal change disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. This is a newly recognized phenomenon, and it has potential implications not only for better molecular mechanistic understanding of the disease, but for identifying novel therapeutics",biorxiv
Integrating large scale genetic and clinical information to predict cases of heart failure,"BackgroundHeart failure (HF) is a major cause of death globally. Prediction of HF risk and early initiation of treatment could mitigate disease progression.  ObjectivesThe study aimed to improve the prediction accuracy of HF by integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS)- and electronic health records (EHR)-derived risk scores.  MethodsWe previously performed the largest HF GWAS to date within the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative to create a polygenic risk score (PRS). To extract clinical information from high-dimensional EHR data, we treated diagnosis codes as  words and leveraged natural language processing techniques to create a clinical risk score (ClinRS). Our method first learned code co-occurrence patterns and extracted 350 latent phenotypes (low-dimensional features) representing EHR codes, then used coefficients from regression of HF on the latent phenotypes in a training set as weights to calculate patient ClinRS in a validation set. Model performances were compared between baseline (age and sex) model and models with risk scores added: 1) PRS, 2) ClinRS, and 3) PRS+ClinRS. We further compared the proposed models with Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) heart failure risk score.  ResultsResults showed that PRS and ClinRS were each able to predict HF outcomes significantly better than the baseline model, up to eight years prior to HF diagnosis. By including both PRS and ClinRS in the model, we achieved superior performance in predicting HF up to ten years prior to HF diagnosis, two years earlier than using a single risk predictor alone. Additionally, we found that ClinRS performed significantly better than ARIC model at one year prior to disease diagnosis.  ConclusionsWe demonstrate the additive power of integrating GWAS- and EHR-derived risk scores to predict HF cases prior to diagnosis",medrxiv
ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel: Reappraisal of Genes associated with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy,"BackgroundHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited cardiac condition affecting [~]1 in 500 and exhibits marked genetic heterogeneity. Previously published in 2019, 57 HCM-associated genes were curated providing the first systematic evaluation of gene-disease validity. Here we report work by the ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel (HCVD-GCEP) to reappraise the clinical validity of previously curated and new putative HCM genes.  MethodsThe ClinGen systematic gene curation framework was used to re-classify the gene-disease relationships for HCM and related syndromic entities involving left ventricular hypertrophy. Genes previously curated were included if their classification was not definitive, and if the time since curation was >2-3 years. New genes with literature assertions for HCM were included for initial evaluation. Existing genes were curated for new inheritance patterns where evidence existed. Curations were presented on twice monthly calls, with the HCVD-GCEP composed of 29 individuals from 21 institutions across 6 countries.  ResultsThirty-one genes were re-curated and an additional 5 new potential HCM-associated genes were curated. Among the re-curated genes, 17 (55%) genes changed classification: 1 limited and 4 disputed (from no known disease relationship), 9 disputed (from limited), and 3 definitive (from moderate). Among these, 3 (10%) genes had a clinically relevant upgrade, including TNNC1, a 9th sarcomere gene with definitive HCM association. With new evidence, two genes were curated for multiple inheritance patterns (TRIM63, disputed for autosomal dominant but moderate for autosomal recessive; ALPK3, strong for autosomal dominant and definitive for recessive). CSRP3 was curated for a semi-dominant mode of inheritance (definitive). Nine (29%) genes were downgraded to disputed, further discouraging clinical reporting of variants in these genes. Five genes recently reported to cause HCM were curated: RPS6KB1 and RBM20 (limited), KLHL24 and MT-TI (moderate), and FHOD3 (definitive).  ConclusionsWe report 29 genes with definitive, strong or moderate evidence of causation for HCM or isolated LVH, including sarcomere, sarcomere-associated and syndromic conditions",medrxiv
Genetic Transformer: An Innovative Large Language Model Driven Approach for Rapid and Accurate Identification of Causative Variants in Rare Genetic Diseases,"BackgroundIdentifying causative variants is crucial for the diagnosis of rare genetic diseases. Over the past two decades, the application of genome sequencing technologies in the field has significantly improved diagnostic outcomes. However, the complexity of data analysis and interpretation continues to limit the efficiency and accuracy of these applications. Various genotype and phenotype-driven filtering and prioritization strategies are used to generate a candidate list of variants for expert curation, with the final report variants determined through knowledge-intensive and labor-intensive expert review. Despite these efforts, the current methods fall short of meeting the growing demand for accurate and efficient diagnosis of rare disease. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) suggest that LLMs possess the potential to augment or even supplant human labor in this context.  MethodsIn this study, we have developed Genetic Transformer (GeneT), an innovative large language model (LLM) driven approach to accelerate identification of candidate causative variants for rare genetic disease. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted between the fine-tuned large language models and four phenotype-driven methods, including Xrare, Exomiser, PhenIX and PHIVE, alongside six pre-trained LLMs (Qwen1.5-0.5B, Qwen1.5-1.8B, Qwen1.5-4B, Mistral-7B, Meta-Llama-3-8B, Meta-Llama-3-70B). This evaluation focused on performance and hallucinations.  ResultsGenetic Transformer (GeneT) as an innovative LLM-driven approach demonstrated outstanding performance on identification of candidate causative variants, identified the average number of candidate causative variants reduced from an average of 418 to 8, achieving recall rate of 99% in synthetic datasets. Application in real-world clinical setting demonstrated the potential for a 20-fold increase in processing speed, reducing the time required to analyze each sample from approximately 60 minutes to around 3 minutes. Concurrently, the recall rate has improved from 94.36% to 97.85%. An online analysis platform iGeneT was developed to integrate GeneT into the workflow of rare genetic disease analysis.  ConclusionOur study represents the inaugural application of fine-tuned LLMs for identifying candidate causative variants, introducing GeneT as an innovative LLM-driven approach, demonstrating its superiority in both simulated data and real-world clinical setting. The study is unique in that it represents a paradigm shift in addressing the complexity of variant filtering and prioritization of whole exome or genome sequencing data, effectively resolving the challenge akin to finding a needle in a haystack",medrxiv
No Relationship between Male Pubertal Timing and Depression: New Insights from Epidemiology and Mendelian Randomization,"BackgroundIn males, the relationship between pubertal timing and depression is understudied and less consistent than in females, likely for reasons of unmeasured confounding. To clarify this relationship, a combined epidemiological and genetic approach was chosen to exploit the methodological advantages of both approaches.  MethodsData from 2,026 males from a nationwide study (KiGGS) were used to investigate the non-/linear relationship between pubertal timing defined by the age at voice break and major depressive disorder (MDD), considering a multitude of potential confounders and their interactions with pubertal timing. This analysis was complemented by Mendelian Randomization (MR), which is robust to inferential problems inherent to epidemiological studies. We used 71 single nucleotide polymorphisms related to pubertal timing in males as instrumental variable to clarify its causal relationship with MDD based on data from 807,553 individuals (246,363 cases and 561,190 controls) by univariable and multivariable MR, including BMI as pleiotropic phenotype.  ResultsUnivariable MR indicated a causal effect of pubertal timing on MDD risk (inverse-variance weighted: OR=0.93, 95%-CI [0.87-0.99)], p=.03). However, this was not confirmed by multivariable MR (inverse-variance weighted: OR=0.95, 95%-CI [0.88-1.02)], p=.13), consistent with the epidemiological approach (OR=1.01, 95%-CI [0.81-1.26], p=.93). Instead, the multivariable MR study indicated a causal relationship of BMI with MDD by two of three methods.  ConclusionsPubertal timing is not related to MDD risk in males. Considering the adverse health outcomes of higher BMI levels, our findings support the rationale for preventive measures to address obesity and its related risk factors",medrxiv
Knowledge Graph-based Thought: a knowledge graph enhanced LLMs framework for pan-cancer question answering,"BackgroundIn recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various domains, notably in biomedical sciences. However, their real-world application is often limited by issues like erroneous outputs and hallucinatory responses.  ResultsWe developed the Knowledge Graph-based Thought (KGT) framework, an innovative solution that integrates LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve their initial responses by utilizing verifiable information from KGs, thus significantly reducing factual errors in reasoning. The KGT framework demonstrates strong adaptability and performs well across various open-source LLMs. Notably, KGT can facilitate the discovery of new uses for existing drugs through potential drug-cancer associations, and can assist in predicting resistance by analyzing relevant biomarkers and genetic mechanisms. To evaluate the Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) task within biomedicine, we utilize a pan-cancer knowledge graph to develop a pan-cancer question answering benchmark, named the Pan-cancer Question Answering (PcQA).  ConclusionsThe KGT framework substantially improves the accuracy and utility of LLMs in the biomedical field. This study serves as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating its exceptional performance in biomedical question answering.  Key PointsO_LIWe introduce a framework combining LLMs with KGs to improve factual accuracy in LLM reasoning.

Post Stroke Motor Recovery Genome-Wide Association Study: A Domain-Specific Approach,"BackgroundIn this genome wide association study (GWAS) we aimed to discover single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with motor recovery post-stroke.  MethodsWe used the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) dataset of 2,100 genotyped patients with non-disabling stroke. Of these, 488 patients had motor impairment at enrollment. Genotyped data underwent strict quality control and imputation. The GWAS utilized logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations (GEE) to leverage the repeated NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) motor score measurements spanning 6 time points over 24 months. The primary outcome was a decrease in the motor drift score of [&ge;] 1 vs. < 1 at each timepoint. Our model estimated the odds ratio of motor improvement for each SNP after adjusting for age, sex, race, days from stroke to visit, initial motor score, VISP treatment arm, and principal components.  ResultsAlthough no associations reached genome-wide significance (p < 5 x 10-8), our analysis detected 115 suggestive associations (p < 5 x 10-6). Notably, we found multiple SNP clusters near genes with plausible neuronal repair biology mechanisms. The CLDN23 gene had the most convincing association which affects blood-brain barrier integrity, neurodevelopment, and immune cell transmigration.  ConclusionWe identified novel suggestive genetic associations with the first ever motor-specific post stroke recovery GWAS. The results seem to describe a distinct stroke recovery phenotype compared to prior genetic stroke outcome studies that use outcome measures, like the mRS. Replication and further mechanistic investigation are warranted. Additionally, this study demonstrated a proof-of-principle approach to optimize statistical efficiency with longitudinal datasets for genetic discovery",medrxiv
Inflammatory Type Focal Cerebral Arteriopathy of the Posterior Circulation in Children: a comparative cohort study,"BackgroundInflammatory type Focal Cerebral Arteriopathy (FCA-i) in the anterior circulation (AC) is well characterized and the FCA severity score (FCASS) reflects the severity of disease. We identified cases of FCA-i in the posterior circulation (PC) and adapted the FCASS to describe these cases.  MethodsPatients from the Swiss NeuroPaediatric Stroke Registry (SNPSR) with ischemic stroke in the PC and AC due to FCA-i and available neuroimaging were gathered. Comparison of data regarding Pediatric National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (pedNIHSS) score and Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM) and FCASS was performed. We estimated infarct size by the modified pediatric Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (pedASPECTS) in children with AC stroke and the adapted Bernese posterior diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) score in the PC.  ResultsThirty-six children with a median age of 6.3 years ([IQR 2.8,8.6; range 0.9,15.6], 21 males, 58.3%) with FCA-i were identified. The total incidence rate was 0.151/100 000/year (95%CI 0.109-0.209). Seven had PC FCA-i and 5 had FCA-i in both circulations. Time to final FCASS was longer in the PC compared to AC, evolution of FCASS did not differ. Initial pedNIHSS was highest in children with FCA-i in the PC with a median of 8.0 (IQR 5.0-18.0), compared to 4.5 (IQR 2.0-8.0) in those with AC FCA-i and 6.0 (IQR 6.0-6.0) with involvement of both AC and PC. Different to the anterior cases PC infarct volume did not correlate with higher discharge, maximum or final FCASS scores (R 0.25, 0.35, 0.54).  ConclusionThe PC is affected in up to one third of cases of FCA-i. These cases should be included in future investigations on FCA-i. Although it did not correlate with clinical outcome in our cohort, the modified FCASS may well serve as a marker for the evolution of the arteriopathy in posterior FCA-i",medrxiv
The role of Late Presenters on HIV-1 transmission clusters in Europe,"BackgroundInvestigating the role of late presenters (LP) on HIV-1 transmission is important, as they can contribute to the onward spread of HIV-1 virus in the long period before diagnosis, when they are not aware of their HIV status  ObjectiveTo describe the clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of HIV-1 infected individuals followed in Europe, to characterize patients in clusters and to compare transmission clusters (TC) in LP vs non-late presenters (NLP) populations.  MethodsClinical, socio-demographic and genotypic information from 38531 HIV-1 infected patients was collected from the EuResist Integrated Database (EIDB) between 1981 and 2019. Sequences were aligned using VIRULIGN. Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies were constructed using FastTree. Putative transmission clusters were identified using ClusterPicker v1.332. Statistical analyses were performed using R.  Results32652 (84{middle dot}7%) sequences were from subtype B, 3603 (9{middle dot}4%) were from subtype G, and 2276 (5{middle dot}9%) were from subtype A. The median age was 33 (IQR: 26{middle dot}0-41{middle dot}0) years old and 75{middle dot}5% of patients were males. The main transmission route was through homosexual (MSM) contact (36{middle dot}9%) and 86{middle dot}4% were originated from Western Europe. Most patients were native (84{middle dot}2%), 59{middle dot}6% had a chronic infection, and 73{middle dot}4% had acquired drug resistance (ADR). CD4 count and viral load at diagnosis (log10) presented a median of 341 cells/mm3, and of log10 4{middle dot}3 copies/mL, respectively. 51{middle dot}4% of patients were classified as LP and 21{middle dot}6% patients were inside TCs. Most patients from subtype B (85{middle dot}6%) were in clusters, compared to subtypes A (5{middle dot}2%) and G (9{middle dot}2%). Phylogenetic analyses showed consistent clustering of MSM individuals. In subtype A, patients in TCs were more frequently MSM patients and with a recent infection. For subtype B, patients in TCs were more frequently those with older age ([&ge;] 56), MSM transmission route, originating from Western Europe, migrants, and with a recent infection. For subtype G, patients in TC were more frequently patients with recent infection and migrants. When analysing cluster size, we found that NLP more frequently belonged to large clusters (>8 patients) when compared to LP.  ConclusionWhile late presentation is still a threat to HIV-1 transmission, LP individuals are more present either outside or in small clusters, indicating a limited role of late presentation to HIV-1 transmission",medrxiv
ChatGPT- versus human-generated answers to frequently asked questions about diabetes: a Turing test-inspired survey among employees of a Danish diabetes center,"BackgroundLarge language models have received enormous attention recently with some studies demonstrating their potential clinical value, despite not being trained specifically for this domain. We aimed to investigate whether ChatGPT, a language model optimized for dialogue, can answer frequently asked questions about diabetes.  MethodsWe conducted a closed e-survey among employees of a large Danish diabetes center. The study design was inspired by the Turing test and non-inferiority trials. Our survey included ten questions with two answers each. One of these was written by a human expert, while the other was generated by ChatGPT. Participants had the task to identify the ChatGPT-generated answer. Data was analyzed at the question-level using logistic regression with robust variance estimation with clustering at participant level. In secondary analyses, we investigated the effect of participant characteristics on the outcome. A 55% non-inferiority margin was pre-defined based on precision simulations and had been published as part of the study protocol before data collection began.  FindingsAmong 311 invited individuals, 183 participated in the survey (59% response rate). 64% had heard of ChatGPT before, and 19% had tried it. Overall, participants could identify ChatGPT-generated answers 59.5% (95% CI: 57.0, 62.0) of the time. Among participant characteristics, previous ChatGPT use had the strongest association with the outcome (odds ratio: 1.52 (1.16, 2.00), p=0.003). Previous users answered 67.4% (61.7, 72.7) of the questions correctly, versus non-users 57.6% (54.9, 60.3).  InterpretationParticipants could distinguish between ChatGPT-generated and human-written answers somewhat better than flipping a fair coin. However, our results suggest a stronger predictive value of linguistic features rather than the actual content. Rigorously planned studies are needed to elucidate the risks and benefits of integrating such technologies in routine clinical practice.  Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA) was released on 30th of November, 2022. A PubMed search for  ChatGPT conducted on 5th of February, 2023, returned 21 results. All of these were either editorials, commentaries or investigated educational perspectives of the technology. We also searched medRxiv, which returned seven preprints on the topic. Two studies investigated ChatGPT  s performance on the United States Medical Licensing Exam and reported that it passed some components of the exam. Other studies investigated ChatGPT  s ability to answer questions in specific medical specialties, including ophthalmology, genetics, musculoskeletal disorders, with encouraging results, but often expressing the need for further specialization. We identified one study where participants had to distinguish between chatbot- and human-generated answers to patient-healthcare provider interactions extracted from electronic health records. Chatbot-generated responses were identified 65% of the time, suggesting that they were weakly distinguishable from human-generated answers.  Added value of this studyOur study is among the first ones to assess the capabilities of ChatGPT from the patients perspective instead of focusing on retrieval of scientific knowledge. We did so in a rigorously designed study inspired by the Turing test and non-inferiority trials. Among all participants, 64% had heard of ChatGPT before, and 19% had tried it. These proportions were even higher among men (87% and 48%). Overall, participants could identify ChatGPT-generated answers (versus human) 60% of the time. We found that individuals who had previously used ChatGPT could distinguish ChatGPT-generated answers from human answers more often, while having contact with patients was not as strong a discriminator. This may suggest a stronger predictive value of linguistic features rather than the actual content.  Implications of all available evidenceAfter ChatGPT, a general-purpose large language model optimized for dialogue, demonstrated its capabilities to the general public, an enormous interest arose in how large language models can support medical research and clinical tasks. Despite not being specifically trained for this, ChatGPT not only has clinical knowledge, but also encodes information about disease management and practical aspects relevant to patients everyday lives. Large language models optimized for healthcare use are warranted, but rigorously planned studies are needed to elucidate the risks and benefits of integrating such technologies in patient care",medrxiv
Evaluating genetically-predicted causal effects of lipoprotein(a) in human diseases: a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization study,"BackgroundLipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is a circulating plasma lipoprotein that is emerging as an important independent risk factor for vascular disease. Lp(a) levels are 75-90% heritable, predominantly determined by copy number variation and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the LPA gene.  MethodsUsing [~]370K individuals with serum measurements of Lp(a) in the UK Biobank European cohort, we constructed a genetic risk score (GRS) consisting of 29 SNPs in the vicinity of LPA which explained 68.18% of variation in Lp(a). Using the LPA GRS to instrument Lp(a), we conducted phenome-wide Mendelian randomization analysis (MR-PheWAS) across a spectrum of 489 medically-relevant phenotypes in [~]7.3M individuals from the 23andMe, Inc. database, and compared effects to those derived from a GRS for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB). Through multivariable MR, we sought to assess the direct causal effect of Lp(a) on cardiovascular disease risks while keeping LDL-C or apoB constant.  ResultsMR-PheWAS confirmed previously reported Lp(a) causal effects on coronary artery disease (CAD: OR = 1.199, 95% CI = [1.193, 1.205], p-value < 2.23x10-308, for every 59.632 nmol/L higher Lp(a) instrumented by the LPA GRS), and revealed additional genetically-predicted effects largely confined to cardiovascular endpoints, including a novel effect for restrictive cardiomyopathy (OR = 1.101, 95% CI = [1.068, 1.134], p-value = 3x10-10). We scaled the LPA, LDL-C and apoB GRS such that they each had the same OR for MACE (major adverse cardiovascular events). Using the scaling rubric, similar magnitudes of effect were seen for the three lipid traits for most vascular diseases, with the exception of peripheral artery disease, aortic stenosis and dilated cardiomyopathy, where Lp(a) had larger genetically-predicted effect sizes compared to LDL-C and apoB. Multivariable MR identified Lp(a) to retain a causal effect on MACE while accounting for LDL-C or apoB. To achieve the 25% relative risk reduction in major vascular events, as seen with a 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C from statin trials, we anticipate that Lp(a) ought to be reduced by [~] 90 mg/dL (200 nmol/L), highlighting the importance of not only using therapies that have a profound impact on Lp(a) lowering, but also selecting individuals that have high Lp(a) concentrations at baseline.  ConclusionLp(a) has genetically-predicted causal effects on a broad range of cardiovascular diseases beyond CAD, with minimal effects seen for non-vascular disease",medrxiv
Graph Attention Networks for Drug Combination Discovery: Targeting Pancreatic Cancer Genes with RAIN Protocol,"BackgroundMalignant neoplasm of the pancreas (MNP), a highly lethal illness with bleak outlook and few therapeutic avenues, entails numerous cellular transformations. These include irregular proliferation of ductal cells, activation of stellate cells, initiation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and changes in cell shape, movement, and attachment. Discovering potent drug cocktails capable of addressing the genetic and protein factors underlying pancreatic cancers development is formidable due to the diseases intricate and varied nature.  MethodIn this study, we introduce a fresh model utilizing Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to pinpoint potential drug pairings with synergistic effects for MNP, following the RAIN protocol. This protocol comprises three primary stages: Initially, employing Graph Neural Network (GNN) to suggest drug combinations for disease management by acquiring embedding vectors of drugs and proteins from a diverse knowledge graph encompassing various biomedical data types, such as drug-protein interactions, gene expression, and drug-target interactions. Subsequently, leveraging natural language processing to gather pertinent articles from clinical trials incorporating the previously recommended drugs. Finally, conducting network meta-analysis to assess the relative effectiveness of these drug combinations.  ResultWe implemented our approach on a network dataset featuring drugs and genes as nodes, connected by edges representing their respective p-values. Our GAT model identified Gemcitabine, Pancrelipase Amylase, and Octreotide as the optimal drug combination for targeting the human genes/proteins associated with this cancer. Subsequent scrutiny of clinical trials and literature confirmed the validity of our findings. Additionally, network meta-analysis confirmed the efficacy of these medications concerning the pertinent genes.  ConclusionBy employing GAT within the RAIN protocol, our approach represents a novel and efficient method for recommending prominent drug combinations to target proteins/genes associated with pancreatic cancer. This technique has the potential to aid healthcare professionals and researchers in identifying optimal treatments for patients while also unveiling underlying disease mechanisms.

"Nucleobindin-1 (Nucb1) disruption affects feeding, metabolism, and glucose homeostasis in mice in an age-, sex-, diet- and light cycle-dependent manner","BackgroundNesfatin-1 (NESF-1), encoded in the calcium and DNA binding protein (Nucleobindin 2, NUCB2) is an orphan ligand with metabolic effects. Recently, our lab provided evidence for a NESF-1-like peptide (NLP) in a NUCB2-related precursor, NUCB1, in zebrafish and rodents. This research aims to determine whether endogenous NUCB1 is critical for energy homeostasis.  Methods and Main FindingsGlobal genetic disruption of Nucb1 (Nucb1 knockout/KO mice) led to increased food intake in chow-fed male and female mice across different points of light and dark phases. A similar increase in water intake was seen in female Nucb1 KO mice but not in males. White adipose tissue weight was significantly increased in male and female Nucb1 KO mice. Dark phase total activity was increased in male Nucb1 KO mice, while it was decreased in female Nucb1 KO mice compared to wildtype littermates. Energy derived from carbohydrates was raised during the dark phase; while energy derived from fat was significantly decreased in both male and female Nucb1 KO mice. Male Nucb1 KO mice were lighter in the early stages, but these differences disappeared as they aged. Meanwhile, no differences in bodyweight were observed in female Nucb1 KO mice. Male Nucb1 KO mice handled glucose better during an oral glucose tolerance test, while the opposite effect was found in an intraperitoneal (IP) glucose tolerance test. The above results from chow-fed mice were largely true in 10% and 60% fat diet-fed mice. A significant two-way interaction between mice group and time was observed on weekly food intake of male and female Nucb1 KO mice fed control fat diet, but not in 60% fat-fed group. Handling of blood glucose during IPGTT was better in male Nucb1 KO mice fed both diets, while such an effect was not observed in female KO mice. A significant two-way interaction of mice group and time on food and water intake value in 24 h was observed for male Nucb1 KO mice fed 10% fat diet. The total physical activity during the dark phase and energy expenditure during the light phase showed a sex-specific pattern in male and female Nucb1 KO mice fed 10% fat diet. Energy expenditure showed a sex-specific pattern in Nucb1 KO mice during the dark phase. Moreover, adiposity increased in male Nucb1 KO mice fed a high fat diet.  ConclusionsOur results indicate that the disruption of Nucb1 leads to metabolic changes in vivo. The phenotype appears to depend on sex, age, diet, and the light-dark cycle. In conclusion, these outcomes furnish important evidence supporting critical roles for endogenous NUCB1 in energy homeostasis",biorxiv
Epistatic Features and Machine Learning Improve Alzheimer's Risk Prediction Over Polygenic Risk Scores,"BackgroundPolygenic risk scores (PRS) are linear combinations of genetic markers weighted by effect size that are commonly used to predict disease risk. For complex heritable diseases such as late onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD), PRS models fail to capture much of the heritability. Additionally, PRS models are highly dependent on the population structure of data on which effect sizes are assessed, and have poor generalizability to new data.  ObjectiveThe goal of this study is to construct a paragenic risk score that, in addition to single genetic marker data used in PRS, incorporates epistatic interaction features and machine learning methods to predict lifetime risk for LOAD.  MethodsWe construct a new state-of-the-art genetic model for lifetime risk of Alzheimers disease. Our approach innovates over PRS models in two ways: First, by directly incorporating epistatic interactions between SNP loci using an evolutionary algorithm guided by shared pathway information; and second, by estimating risk via an ensemble of machine learning models (gradient boosting machines and deep learning) instead of simple logistic regression. We compare the paragenic model to a PRS model from the literature trained on the same dataset.  ResultsThe paragenic model is significantly more accurate than the PRS model under 10-fold cross-validation, obtaining an AUC of 83% and near-clinically significant matched sensitivity/specificity of 75%, and remains significantly more accurate when evaluated on an independent holdout dataset. Additionally, the paragenic model maintains accuracy within APOE genotypes.  ConclusionParagenic models show potential for improving lifetime disease risk prediction for complex heritable diseases such as LOAD over PRS models",medrxiv
"Acute myocardial infarction, 90 Cardiovascular proteins and Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia: a Mendelian randomization study","BackgroundPrevious studies have shown that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may be associated with paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia (PVT). However, the causal effect between AMI and PVT, and whether cardiovascular proteins act as a mediator remain unclear.  MethodsThe genetic data of AMI, 90 Cardiovascular proteins (CVPs) and PVT were obtained from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The Mendelian randomization analysis was applied to evaluate the casual association among the AMI, CVPs and PVT. The inverse variance weighting casual effect was regarded as main statistical method. We further investigated whether CVPs take a mediating role in the pathway from AMI to PVT.  ResultsThere were three positive, including ESM-1 (OR 1.139, 95%CI 1.034-1.255, P-FDR=0.014), GAL (OR 1.105,95%CI 1.025-1.191, P-FDR=0.015) and PRL (OR 1.084, 95%CI 1.004-1.170, P-FDR=0.038), and four negative, including FAS (OR 0.928, 95%CI 0.885-0.974, P-FDR=0.009), LEP (OR 0.938, 95%CI 0.891-0.987, P-FDR=0.018), TNF-R1 (OR 0.930, 95%CI 0.883-0.979, P-FDR=0.014) and TNF-R2 (OR 0.928, 95%CI 0.883-0.974, P-FDR=0.009), casual effects between genetic liability of AMI on CVPs. We identified two positive, including IL-27 (OR 1.371, 95%CI 1.010-1.861, P-FDR=0.045) and MMP-12 (OR 1.330, 95%CI 1.035-1.709, P-FDR=0.045), and two negative, including LEP (OR 0.614, 95%CI 0.384-0.981, P-FDR=0.045) and TF (OR 0.714, 95%CI 0.514-0.992, P-FDR=0.045), casual effects between genetic liability of CVPs on PVT. In addition, the AMI played a positive casual effect on PVT (OR 1.736, 95%CI 1.300-2.318, P-FDR<0.001) mediating by LEP with 5.71%.  ConclusionsThe AMI was casually correlated to PVT, and LEP acted as a mediator in the pathway from AMI to PVT.  Key MessagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topic?C_ST_ABSPrevious retrospective and prospective clinical studies have suggested that attention should be paid to the risk of subsequent malignant ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, in patients with acute myocardial infarction.  What this study adds?We used Mendelian randomization to demonstrate the genetic relationship between acute myocardial infarction and paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia, and found that leptin mediated the occurrence of paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia in clinical patients with acute myocardial infarction for the first time. In addition, we also found a large number of cardiovascular proteins closely genetically related to acute myocardial infarction or paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia,  How this study might affect research, practice or policy?Our research provides a new insight which means that appropriate serological detection or intervention for patients with acute myocardial infarction can predict or prevent the occurrence of secondary malignant ventricular arrhythmias and reduce the mortality of patients with acute myocardial infarction in the future. Also, the cardiovascular proteins detected by Mendelian randomization analysis are helpful for the diagnosis and prevention of the two.

Proteomic Networks and Related Genetic Variants Associated with Smoking and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"BackgroundStudies have identified individual blood biomarkers associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and related phenotypes. However, complex diseases such as COPD typically involve changes in multiple molecules with interconnections that may not be captured when considering single molecular features.  MethodsLeveraging proteomic data from 3,173 COPDGene Non-Hispanic White (NHW) and African American (AA) participants, we applied sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet) to 4,776 proteins assayed on the SomaScan v4.0 platform to derive sparse networks of proteins associated with current vs. former smoking status, airflow obstruction, and emphysema quantitated from high-resolution computed tomography scans. We then used NetSHy, a dimension reduction technique leveraging network topology, to produce summary scores of each proteomic network, referred to as NetSHy scores. We next performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify variants associated with the NetSHy scores, or network quantitative trait loci (nQTLs). Finally, we evaluated the replicability of the networks in an independent cohort, SPIROMICS.  ResultsWe identified networks of 13 to 104 proteins for each phenotype and exposure in NHW and AA, and the derived NetSHy scores significantly associated with the variable of interests. Networks included known (sRAGE, ALPP, MIP1) and novel molecules (CA10, CPB1, HIS3, PXDN) and interactions involved in COPD pathogenesis. We observed 7 nQTL loci associated with NetSHy scores, 4 of which remained after conditional analysis. Networks for smoking status and emphysema, but not airflow obstruction, demonstrated a high degree of replicability across race groups and cohorts.  ConclusionsIn this work, we apply state-of-the-art molecular network generation and summarization approaches to proteomic data from COPDGene participants to uncover protein networks associated with COPD phenotypes. We further identify genetic associations with networks. This work discovers protein networks containing known and novel proteins and protein interactions associated with clinically relevant COPD phenotypes across race groups and cohorts",medrxiv
Behavioral and genetic markers of susceptibility to escalate fentanyl intake,"BackgroundThe ""loss of control"" over drug consumption, present in opioid use disorder (OUD) and known as escalation of intake, is well-established in preclinical rodent models. However, little is known about how antecedent behavioral characteristics, such as valuation of hedonic reinforcers prior to drug use, may impact the trajectory of fentanyl intake over time. Moreover, it is unclear if distinct escalation phenotypes may be driven by genetic markers predictive of OUD susceptibility.  MethodsMale and female Sprague-Dawley rats (n=63) were trained in a sucrose reinforcement task using a progressive ratio schedule. Individual differences in responsivity to sucrose were hypothesized to predict escalation of fentanyl intake. Rats underwent daily 1-h acquisition sessions for i.v. fentanyl self-administration (2.5 {micro}g/kg; FR1) for 7 days, followed by 21 6-h escalation sessions, then tissue from prefrontal cortex was collected for RNA sequencing and qPCR. Latent growth curve and group-based trajectory modeling were used, respectively, to evaluate the association between sucrose reinforcement and fentanyl self-administration and to identify whether distinct escalation phenotypes can be linked to gene expression patterns.  ResultsSucrose breakpoints were not predictive of fentanyl acquisition nor change during escalation, but did predict fentanyl intake on the first day of extended access to fentanyl. Permutation analyses did not identify associations between behavior and single gene expression when evaluated overall, or between our ascertained phenotypes. However, weighted genome correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) determined several gene modules linked to escalated fentanyl intake, including genes coding for voltage-gated potassium channels, calcium channels, and genes involved in excitatory synaptic signaling. Transcription factor analyses identified EZH2 and JARID2 as potential transcriptional regulators associated with escalated fentanyl intake. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) term categories were also generated and positively associated with terms relating to substance use disorders.  DiscussionEscalation of opioid intake is largely distinct from motivation for natural reward, such as sucrose. Further, the gene networks associated with fentanyl escalation suggest that engagement of select molecular pathways distinguish individuals with ""addiction prone"" behavioral endophenotypes, potentially representing druggable targets for opioid use disorder. Our extended in silico identification of SNPs and transcription factors associated with the ""addiction prone"" high escalating rats highlights the importance of integrating findings from translational preclinical models. Through a precision medicine approach, our results may aid in the development of patient-centered treatment options for those with OUD",biorxiv
"biobank.cy: The Biobank of Cyprus past, present and future","BackgroundThe Cyprus Biobank collects biosamples, medical and lifestyle information with the aim of reaching 16,500 Cypriots aged [&ge;]18-years, by year 2027, as part of a multitasked EU funded project. Volunteers are both from the general population and from disease cohorts of focused research projects, who amongst others will contribute to canvas the architecture of the Cyprus human genome and study the healthy and morbid anatomy of Cypriots. The Cyprus Biobank is a research infrastructure pillar of the biobank.cy Center of Excellence in Biobanking and Biomedical Research.  MethodsWithin 3-years (November 2019-October 2022), 1348 participants of the general population who represent a subset of the Cyprus Biobank recruited individuals, were enrolled in the pilot study. The study did not include individuals from separate disease-specific cohorts. Extensive information was collected from each participant, including biochemistry, complete blood count, physiological, anthropometric, socio-demographic, diet, and lifestyle characteristics. Prevalent health conditions along with medication use and family history were recorded, including 58 biomarkers based on blood and urine samples. With a systematic recruitment campaign, the Biobank is continuously increasing the number of individuals in the general population cohort and is developing separate disease cohorts of the Cypriot population.  ResultsThe pilot study enrolled 579 men and 769 women, aged between 18-85 years (median 48-years). The enrollment takes 40 minutes on average, including the collection of biological samples and phenotypic information. More than half (n=733, 55%) of the participants are educated to college level or above. Statistically significant differences were found between men and women regarding their education level (p<0.001), marital status (p=0.01) and employment status (p<0.001) but not their age (p=0.29). The most prevalent medical conditions recorded are hypertension (17.2%), osteoporosis (6.9%) and diabetes (6.0%).  ConclusionsThe Cyprus biobanking pilot study has successfully collected extensive baseline information from enrolled participants. The Biobank will comprise a rich data resource used to examine the major risk factors leading to public health burdens and develop strategies for disease prevention",medrxiv
Automated Derivation of Diagnostic Criteria for Lung Cancer using Natural Language Processing on Electronic Health Records: A pilot study,"BackgroundThe digitisation of healthcare records has generated vast amounts of unstructured data, presenting opportunities for improvements in disease diagnosis when clinical coding falls short, such as in the recording of patient symptoms. This study presents an approach using natural language processing to extract clinical concepts from free-text which are used to automatically form diagnostic criteria for lung cancer from unstructured secondary-care data.  MethodsPatients aged 40 and above who underwent a chest x-ray (CXR) between 2016-2022 were included. ICD-10 and unstructured data were pulled from their electronic health records (EHRs) over the preceding 12 months to the CXR. The unstructured data were processed using named entity recognition to extract symptoms, which were mapped to SNOMED-CT codes. Subsumption of features up the SNOMED-CT hierarchy was used to mitigate against sparse features and a frequency-based criteria, combined with univariate logarithmic probabilities, was applied to select candidate features to take forward to the model development phase. A genetic algorithm was employed to identify the most discriminating features to form the diagnostic criteria.  Results75002 patients were included, with 1012 lung cancer diagnoses made within 12 months of the CXR. The best-performing model achieved an AUROC of 0.72. Results showed that an existing  disorder of the lung, such as pneumonia, and a  cough increased the probability of a lung cancer diagnosis.  Anomalies of great vessel,  disorder of the retroperitoneal compartment and  context-dependent findings, such as pain, statistically reduced the risk of lung cancer, making other diagnoses more likely. The performance of the developed model was compared to the existing cancer risk scores, demonstrating superior performance.  ConclusionsThe proposed methods demonstrated success in leveraging unstructured secondary-care data to derive diagnostic criteria for lung cancer, outperforming existing risk tools. These advancements show potential for enhancing patient care and results. However, it is essential to tackle specific limitations by integrating primary care data to ensure a more thorough and unbiased development of diagnostic criteria. Moreover, the study highlights the importance of contextualising SNOMED-CT concepts into meaningful terminology that resonates with clinicians, facilitating a clearer and more tangible understanding of the criteria applied",medrxiv
Real-World Genetic Characteristics of Candidates for Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators with Dilated Cardiomyopathy,"BackgroundThe real-world prevalence of sudden cardiac death (SCD)-related gene mutations and their relationship with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has not been clearly investigated.  MethodsThis study included patients with sporadic DCM with persistent left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [&le;] 35% even after 3 months of guideline-directed medical treatment or those with an ICD for secondary prevention and LVEF < 50%. Genetic tests targeting 444 pan-cardiomyopathy genes (including 36 core DCM genes) were performed, along with the collection of clinical and electrophysiological information.  ResultsA total of 105 patients were enrolled (median age, 65.0 [57.5-75.0] years), and 33 (31%) were women. The average LVEF was 27.4 {+/-} 5.9%, and 46 patients (44%) had ICD or cardiac resynchronization therapy with ICD (34 for primary prevention and 12 for secondary prevention purpose) at the time of enrollment. Fourteen patients (13%) had pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants (comprising 6 TTN, 4 DSP, 2 TNNT2, 1 RBM20, 1 DSG and 1 MYBPC3, one patients had both DSP and RBM20), and 59 patients (56%) had P/LP/variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in the 36 core DCM genes. Twenty-eight patients (27%) harbored SCD-related gene variants (14 DSP, 11FLNC, 9 RBM20 and 2 TMEM43). The prevalence of SCD gene variants tended to be higher in the secondary prevention and non-ICD groups (33.3% for secondary purposes, 11.8% for primary purposes, and 33.8% for non-ICD; p = 0.058).  ConclusionsIn patients with advanced heart failure and DCM, P/LP-validated DCM variants were not common in sporadic cases. However, when extended to VUS, approximately half of the patients had core DCM-related variants. The prevalence of SCD variants was not lower in the non-ICD group, thus suggesting a potential risk of fatal arrhythmia.  (Trial registration: CRIS KCT0004913)",medrxiv
Emerging Drug Combinations for Targeting Tongue Neoplasms Associated Proteins/Genes: Employing Graph Neural Networks within the RAIN Protocol,"BackgroundTongue Neoplasms is a common form of malignancy, with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue being the most frequently diagnosed type due to regular mechanical stimulation. Its prevalence remains on the rise among neoplastic cancer cases. Finding effective combinations of drugs to target the genetic and protein elements contributing to the development of Managing Tongue Neoplasms poses a difficulty owing to the intricate and varied nature of the ailment.  MethodIn this research, we introduce a novel approach using Deep Modularity Networks (DMoN) to identify potential synergistic drug combinations for the condition, following the RAIN protocol. This procedure comprises three primary phases: First, employing Graph Neural Network (GNN) to propose drug combinations for treating the ailment by extracting embedding vectors of drugs and proteins from an extensive knowledge graph containing various biomedical data types, such as drug-protein interactions, gene expression, and drug-target interactions. Second, utilizing natural language processing to gather pertinent articles from clinical trials involving the previously recommended drugs.

"Genetic evidence for efficacy of targeting IL-2, IL-6, and TYK2 signaling in prevention of type 1 diabetes: A Mendelian randomization study","BackgroundType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, which leads to insulin dependence. We investigated genetic evidence to support the repurposing of seven drugs, already licensed or in clinical phases of development, for prevention of type 1 diabetes.  MethodsWe obtained genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for the risk of type 1 diabetes, whole-blood gene expression, and serum protein levels, and investigated genetic polymorphisms near seven potential drug target genes. We used colocalization to examine whether the same genetic variants that are associated with type 1 diabetes risk were also associated with the relevant drug target genetic proxies, and Mendelian randomization to evaluate the direction and magnitude of the associations. Furthermore, we performed Mendelian randomization analysis restricted to functional variants within the drug target genes.  FindingsColocalization revealed that the blood interleukin (IL)-2 receptor subunit alpha (IL2RA) and IL-6 receptor (IL6R) gene expression levels within the corresponding genes shared the same causal variant with type 1 diabetes liability (posterior probabilities 100% and 96.3%, respectively). Odds ratios (OR) of type 1 diabetes per 1-SD increase in the genetically proxied gene expression of IL2RA and IL6R were 0.22 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.27) and 1.98 (95% CI 1.48-2.65), respectively. Using missense variants, genetically proxied tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) expression levels were associated with type 1 diabetes risk (OR 0.61, 95% CI [0.54-0.70]).  InterpretationOur findings support the targeting of IL-2, IL-6R and TYK2 signaling in prevention of type 1 diabetes. Further studies should assess the optimal window to intervene to prevent type 1 diabetes.  FundingKyllikki ja Uolevi Lehikoisen saatio, Foundation for Pediatric Research, Finnish Cultural Foundation, JDRF International; The University of Oulu & The Research Council of Finland Profi 326291; European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement no. 848158 (EarlyCause).  Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for GWAS, Mendelian randomization, colocalization, and other studies for genetic evidence of efficacy of targeting IL2RA, IL2RB, IL6R, IL6ST, IL23A, TYK2, JAK2, and JAK3 signaling in prevention of type 1 diabetes. We searched studies with combinations of ""IL2RA"", ""IL2RB"", ""IL6R"", ""IL6ST"", ""IL23A"", ""JAK2"", ""JAK3"", ""TYK2"", ""colocalization"", ""mendelian randomization"", or ""GWAS"" and ""Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1""[Mesh].  A recent large GWAS by Robertson et al. observed five conditionally independent genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of type 1 diabetes in intergenic and intronic areas near IL2RA. Another large recent GWAS by Chiou et al. found six independent SNPs associated with the risk of type 1 diabetes near IL2RA. A few smaller candidate gene studies also reported associations between the risk of type 1 diabetes and eight other loci near IL2RA. Epigenetic studies reported that a few type 1 diabetes risk variants near IL2RA are associated with changes in methylation of DNA near promoters of IL2RA in white blood cells and B-cells.  Both above mentioned GWAS found associations between two missense mutations in TYK2 gene (rs12720356(A>C), rs34536443(G>C)) and the risk of type 1 diabetes. The same variants protected against type 1 diabetes and some other autoimmune diseases in a Finnish FINNGEN biobank study. Smaller candidate gene studies found that the rs2304256 A/A genotype was protective against type 1 diabetes in a Southern Brazilian and in a European population. In a study of Japanese population, similar association was not seen, possibly due to differences in allele frequencies and incidence of type 1 diabetes between populations. In the same study, TYK2 promoter haplotype with genetic polymorphisms in promoter region and exon 1 decreased the promoter activity and increased the risk for type 1 diabetes. The minor 358Ala allele of the IL6R SNP rs2228145 (A>C) was found to be associated with a reduced risk of developing T1D.  In addition to loci near or at IL2RA and TYK2 loci, the GWAS by Robertson et al. reported an association between rs2229238 near IL6R and the risk of type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, a candidate gene study found that the GG haplotypes of variants rs11171806 and rs2066808 (in strong LD) near IL23A was protective against T1D.  We found no studies in which colocalization between the loci near the reviewed genes and type 1 diabetes was reported nor estimates from Mendelian randomization on the possible causal relationship. However, Robertson et al. studied the genetic evidence for therapeutic potential of their GWAS hits using a priority index algorithm, which combined information from GWAS of type 1 diabetes, expression quantitative loci in immune cells, evidence from chromatin conformation in immune cells, as well as protein-protein interactions and genomic annotations. Among the reported GWAS hits, priority index ranked IL2RA as the top target, followed by TYK2 (the 3rd target), JAK2 (11th), IL23 (25th), JAK3 (35th), and IL6R (50th).  Added value of this studyWe found that the risk of type 1 diabetes and whole-blood gene expression of IL2RA and IL6R colocalized to rs61839660 near IL2RA and rs10908839 near IL6R, respectively. Using these loci as instruments of IL2RA and IL6R expression, Mendelian randomization indicated that whole blood IL2RA expression is associated with decreased risk of type 1 diabetes (OR 0.70 per 1 SD increase) whereas IL6R expression is associated with increased risk (OR 1.079 per 1 SD increase). Furthermore, when a missense variant rs2304256 in TYK2 was used as an instrument for TYK2 expression, Mendelian randomization indicated that an SD increase in TYK2 expression was predicted to decrease the risk of type 1 diabetes (OR 0.61).  Implications of all the available evidenceWe found genetic evidence supporting the efficacy of targeting IL-2, IL-6 and TYK2 signalling in prevention of type 1 diabetes. Further research is needed to address when would be the most optimal time to intervene in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes",medrxiv
Healthcare utilization and clinical characteristics of genetic epilepsy syndromes: a longitudinal case-control study of electronic health records,"BackgroundUnderstanding disease progression, age-specific comorbidities, medical treatment patterns, and unmet needs can help improve the care pathway of individuals with rare genetic epilepsies. A matched longitudinal cohort study has not been performed for these variables from childhood to adolescence across the whole phenome.  MethodsWe identified individuals with likely genetic and non-genetic epilepsy syndromes and onset at ages 0-5 years by linkage across the Cleveland Clinic Health System. We used natural language processing to extract medical terms and procedures from longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) and tested for cross-sectional and temporal associations with genetic epilepsies.  FindingsWe identified 503 individuals with genetic epilepsy syndromes and matched controls with epilepsy that did not receive genetic testing. The median age at the first encounter was 0{middle dot}1 years, 7{middle dot}9 years at the last encounter, and the mean duration of follow-up was 8{middle dot}2 years. We extracted 188,295 Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) annotations for statistical analysis across 9,659 encounters. Individuals with genetic epilepsy syndromes received an earlier epilepsy diagnosis and had more frequent and complex encounters with the healthcare system. Notably, the highest enrichment of encounters compared to the non-genetic groups was found during the transition from paediatric to adult care. Our computational approach could validate established comorbidities of genetic epilepsies, such as behavioural abnormality and intellectual disability. We also revealed novel associations for genitourinary abnormalities (OR 1{middle dot}91, 95% CI: 1{middle dot}66-2{middle dot}19, p = 2{middle dot}39x10-19) linked to a spectrum of underrecognized genetic syndromes.  InterpretationThis study identified novel features associated with the likelihood of a genetic epilepsy syndrome and quantified the healthcare utilization of genetic epilepsies compared to matched controls with epilepsy who did not receive genetic testing. Our results strongly recommend early genetic testing to stratify individuals into specialized care paths, thus improving the clinical management of people with genetic epilepsies.

Identification of Parthenogenesis-Inducing Effector Proteins in Wolbachia,"Bacteria in the genus Wolbachia have evolved numerous strategies to manipulate arthropod sex, including the conversion of would-be male offspring to asexually reproducing females. This so-called ""parthenogenesis induction"" phenotype can be found in a number of Wolbachia strains that infect arthropods with haplodiploid sex determination systems, including parasitoid wasps. Despite the discovery of microbe-mediated parthenogenesis more than 30 yr ago, the underlying genetic mechanisms have remained elusive. We used a suite of genomic, computational, and molecular tools to identify and characterize two proteins that are uniquely found in parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia and have strong signatures of host-associated bacterial effector proteins. These putative parthenogenesis-inducing proteins have structural homology to eukaryotic protein domains including nucleoporins, the key insect sex determining factor Transformer, and a eukaryotic-like serine-threonine kinase with leucine-rich repeats. Furthermore, these proteins significantly impact eukaryotic cell biology in the model Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Cytosolic bacterial pathogens activate TLR pathways in tumors that synergistically enhance STING agonist cancer therapies,"Bacterial pathogens that invade the eukaryotic cytosol are distinctive tools for fighting cancer, as they preferentially target tumors and can deliver cancer antigens to MHC-I. Cytosolic bacterial pathogens have undergone extensive preclinical development and human clinical trials, yet the molecular mechanisms by which they are detected by innate immunity in tumors is unclear. We report that intratumoral delivery of phylogenetically distinct cytosolic pathogens, including Listeria, Rickettsia, and Burkholderia species, elicited anti-tumor responses in established, poorly immunogenic melanoma and lymphoma in mice. We were surprised to observe that although the bacteria required entry to the cytosol, the anti-tumor responses were largely independent of the cytosolic sensors cGAS/STING and instead required TLR signaling. Combining pathogens with TLR agonists did not enhance anti-tumor efficacy, while combinations with STING agonists elicited profound, synergistic anti-tumor effects with complete responses in >80% of mice after a single dose. Small molecule TLR agonists also synergistically enhanced the anti-tumor activity of STING agonists. The anti-tumor effects were diminished in Rag2-deficient mice and upon CD8 T cell depletion. Mice cured from combination therapy developed immunity to cancer rechallenge that was superior to STING agonist monotherapy. Together, these data provide a framework for enhancing the efficacy of microbial cancer therapies and small molecule innate immune agonists, via the co-activation of STING and TLRs",biorxiv
SRTRP-Net: A multi-task learning network for segmentation and prediction of stereotactic radiosurgery treatment response in brain metastases,"Before the Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) treatment, it is of great clinical significance to avoid secondary genetic damage and guide the personalized treatment plans for patients with brain metastases (BM) by predicting the response to SRS treatment of brain metastatic lesions. Thus, we developed a multi-task learning model termed SRTRP-Net to provide prior knowledge of BM ROI and predict the SRS treatment response of the lesion. In dual-encoder tumor segmentation Network (DTS-Net), two parallel encoders encode the original and mirrored multi-modal MRI images. The differences in the dual-encoder features between foreground and background are enhanced by the symmetrical visual difference block (SVDB). In the bottom layer of the encoder, a transformer is used to extract local contextual features in the spatial and depth dimensions of low-resolution images. Then, the decoder of DTS-Net provides the prior knowledge for predicting the response to SRS treatment by performing BM segmentation. SRS response prediction network (SRP-Net) directly utilizes shared multi-modal MRI features weighted by the signed distance map (SDM) of the masks. The bidirectional multi-dimensional feature fusion module (BMDF) fuses the shared features and the clinical text information features to obtain comprehensive tumor information for characterizing tumors and predicting SRS treatment response. Experiments based on internal and external clinical datasets have shown that SRTRP-Net achieves comparable or better results. We believe that SRTRP-Net can help clinicians accurately develop personalized first-time treatment regimens for BM patients and improve their survival",PubMed
Role of artificial intelligence in predicting neurological outcomes in postcardiac resuscitation,"Being an extremely high mortality rate condition, cardiac arrest cases have rightfully been evaluated via various studies and scoring factors for effective resuscitative practices and neurological outcomes postresuscitation. This narrative review aims to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting neurological outcomes postcardiac resuscitation. The methodology involved a detailed review of all relevant recent studies of AI, different machine learning algorithms, prediction tools, and assessing their benefit in predicting neurological outcomes in postcardiac resuscitation cases as compared to more traditional prognostic scoring systems and tools. Previously, outcome determining clinical, blood, and radiological factors were prone to other influencing factors like limited accuracy and time constraints. Studies conducted also emphasized that to predict poor neurological outcomes, a more multimodal approach helped adjust for confounding factors, interpret diverse datasets, and provide a reliable prognosis, which only demonstrates the need for AI to help overcome challenges faced. Advanced machine learning algorithms like artificial neural networks (ANN) using supervised learning by AI have improved the accuracy of prognostic models outperforming conventional models. Several real-world cases of effective AI-powered algorithm models have been cited here. Studies comparing machine learning tools like XGBoost, AI Watson, hyperspectral imaging, ChatGPT-4, and AI-based gradient boosting have noted their beneficial uses. AI could help reduce workload, healthcare costs, and help personalize care, process vast genetic and lifestyle data and help reduce side effects from treatments. Limitations of AI have been covered extensively in this article, including data quality, bias, privacy issues, and transparency. Our objectives should be to use more diverse data sources, use interpretable data output giving process explanation, validation method, and implement policies to safeguard patient data. Despite the limitations, the advancements already made by AI and its potential in predicting neurological outcomes in postcardiac resuscitation cases has been quite promising and boosts a continually improving system, albeit requiring close human supervision with training and improving models, with plans to educate clinicians, the public and sharing collected data",PubMed
Sord deficient rats develop a motor-predominant peripheral neuropathy unveiling novel pathophysiological insights,"Biallelic SORD mutations cause one of the most frequent forms of recessive hereditary neuropathy, estimated to affect approximately 10,000 patients in North America and Europe alone. Pathogenic SORD loss-of-function changes in the encoded enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase result in abnormally high sorbitol levels in cells and serum. How sorbitol accumulation leads to peripheral neuropathy remains to be elucidated. A reproducible animal model for SORD neuropathy is essential to illuminate the pathogenesis of SORD deficiency and for preclinical studies of potential therapies. Therefore, we have generated a Sord knockout (KO), Sord-/-, Sprague Dawley rat, to model the human disease and to investigate the pathophysiology underlying SORD deficiency. We have characterized the phenotype in these rats with a battery of behavioral tests as well as biochemical, physiological, and comprehensive histological examinations. Sord-/- rats had remarkably increased levels of sorbitol in serum, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), and peripheral nerve. Moreover, serum from Sord-/- rats contained significantly increased levels of neurofilament light chain, NfL, an established biomarker for axonal degeneration. Motor performance significantly declined in Sord-/- animals starting at [~]7 months of age. Gait analysis evaluated with video motion tracking confirmed abnormal gait patterns in the hindlimbs. Motor nerve conduction velocities of the tibial nerves were slowed. Light and electron microscopy of the peripheral nervous system revealed degenerating myelinated axons, de- and remyelinated axons, and a likely pathognomonic finding - enlarged ""ballooned"" myelin sheaths. These findings mainly affected myelinated motor axons; myelinated sensory axons were largely spared.

A narrative review of genes associated with liver fibrosis in biliary atresia,"Biliary atresia (BA) is characterized by biliary inflammation and obstruction. In the later phase, liver fibrosis occurs. Although the etiology of BA is believed to be multi-factorial, genetic predisposition has been proposed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis. This review aimed to provide an updated summary of the genes that have been reported to be involved in BA-associated liver fibrosis. The review was conducted via evaluation of MalaCards (BA disease: MalaCards-research articles, drugs, genes, clinical trials) which is a universally applied website including various human disease database. The database of genes that are involved in liver fibrosis were studied. Thirty-one genes that are associated with BA according to the disease relevance score were reviewed after further evaluations. Eleven genes (GPT, NR1H4, TGF-B1, MMP7, CCN2, TIMP1, SPP1, ADD3, KRT7, ADD3-AS1, SOX9) that are specific and with a potential association with liver fibrosis were selected for detailed description. Increased expression of GPT, TGF-B1, MMP7, CCN2, TIMP1, SPP1, ADD3, KRT7 and ADD3-AS1 maybe associated with the development of liver fibrosis in BA patients, while the expression of NR1H4 and SOX9 are more likely to suppress liver fibrosis. Current scientific evidence using gene database has revealed a close association between genetic anomalies and the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis in BA. With a better understanding of these anomalies, therapy targeting these related genes may be a new therapeutic approach to alleviate liver fibrosis in BA",PubMed
OMICmAge: An integrative multi-omics approach to quantify biological age with electronic medical records,"Biological aging is a multifactorial process involving complex interactions of cellular and biochemical processes that is reflected in omic profiles. Using common clinical laboratory measures in ~30,000 individuals from the MGB-Biobank, we developed a robust, predictive biological aging phenotype, EMRAge, that balances clinical biomarkers with overall mortality risk and can be broadly recapitulated across EMRs. We then applied elastic-net regression to model EMRAge with DNA-methylation (DNAm) and multiple omics, generating DNAmEMRAge and OMICmAge, respectively. Both biomarkers demonstrated strong associations with chronic diseases and mortality that outperform current biomarkers across our discovery (MGB-ABC, n=3,451) and validation (TruDiagnostic, n=12,666) cohorts. Through the use of epigenetic biomarker proxies, OMICmAge has the unique advantage of expanding the predictive search space to include epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and clinical data while distilling this in a measure with DNAm alone, providing opportunities to identify clinically-relevant interconnections central to the aging process",biorxiv
Scalable and universal prediction of cellular phenotypes,"Biological systems can be understood by perturbing individual components and studying the systems response. Cell biology experiments are defined by the applied treatment, cellular state, and the assayed phenotype. Given the vast number of possible combinations, testing every scenario is impractical. We present Prophet, a transformer-based computational model for cellular phenotype prediction. Prophet learns a representation of the cell biology experiment space, enabling it to predict the outcomes of untested small molecule or genetic perturbations in new cellular contexts across diverse phenotypes including gene expression, cell viability, and cell morphology. Its scalable architecture facilitates training across independent assays, using transfer learning to enhance performance across phenotypes. In vitro validation shows Prophets potential to guide experimental design, making it a valuable tool for accelerating biological discovery",biorxiv
PubMed and Beyond: Biomedical Literature Search in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,"Biomedical research yields a wealth of information, much of which is only accessible through the literature. Consequently, literature search is an essential tool for building on prior knowledge in clinical and biomedical research. Although recent improvements in artificial intelligence have expanded functionality beyond keyword-based search, these advances may be unfamiliar to clinicians and researchers. In response, we present a survey of literature search tools tailored to both general and specific information needs in biomedicine, with the objective of helping readers efficiently fulfill their information needs. We first examine the widely used PubMed search engine, discussing recent improvements and continued challenges. We then describe literature search tools catering to five specific information needs: 1. Identifying high-quality clinical research for evidence-based medicine. 2. Retrieving gene-related information for precision medicine and genomics. 3. Searching by meaning, including natural language questions. 4. Locating related articles with literature recommendation. 5. Mining literature to discover associations between concepts such as diseases and genetic variants. Additionally, we cover practical considerations and best practices for choosing and using these tools. Finally, we provide a perspective on the future of literature search engines, considering recent breakthroughs in large language models such as ChatGPT. In summary, our survey provides a comprehensive view of biomedical literature search functionalities with 36 publicly available tools",arXiv
Blau syndrome with persistent fetal vasculature: a case report,"Blau Syndrome (BS) is a rare autosomal dominant noncaseous granulomatous disease caused by mutations in the NOD2 gene. The disease is characterized by granulomatous dermatitis, symmetrical arthritis, and uveitis, which, if left untreated, can progress to blindness. The diagnosis of BS can be challenging because of its rarity and overlap with other rheumatologic disorders. Early detection of ocular involvement is critical to prevent vision loss and improve the prognosis of patients with BS. In this report, we present a case of a five-year-old Chinese girl diagnosed with BS one year ago after presenting with a systemic rash and urinary calculi. Genetic testing was recommended by a physician, and a heterozygous mutation of the NOD2 gene c.1538T > C (p.M513T) was identified. Eight months ago, due to bilateral corneal punctate opacity, we had examined and diagnosed bilateral uveitis, bilateral corneal zonal degeneration, persistent fetal vasculature (PFV) in the right eye, and perivascular granuloma in the right eye. As a result, Vitrectomy was performed on the right eye, resulting in a significant improvement in visual acuity from 1/50 on the first day after surgery to 3/10 after 1 week. After 6 months, the visual acuity of the right eye was maintained at 3/20, but opacification of the lens posterior capsule was observed. Follow-up appointments are ongoing to monitor the condition of the affected eyes. Our report underscores the importance of prompt detection and management of ocular involvement in BS accompany with PFV to prevent vision loss and improve patient outcomes. This report details the case of a child diagnosed with BS who accompanied a periretinal granuloma and PFV in the right eye. Regrettably, the left eye was observed to have no light perception (NLP) with the fundus not being visible. The occurrence of ocular complications in patients with BS, must be closely monitored to prevent vision loss and enhance treatment outcomes. This case underscores the importance of prompt diagnosis and management of ocular complications in patients with BS to prevent further damage and optimize patient outcomes",PubMed
Right-Sided Ectopic Intrathoracic Kidney Associated With Symptomatic Bochdalek Hernia in an Adult Indian Female: Case Report and Review of Literature,"Bochdalek hernia is an inherited posterior lateral defect in the diaphragm that allows the abdominal organs to herniate into the thoracic cavity. In addition to being the most prevalent variety of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), it is also the type that is observed on the left hemithorax the majority of the time. Ectopic kidney is an uncommon condition, and the occurrence of ectopic intrathoracic kidney is even more uncommon, accounting for only a few of all the cases of renal ectopias. The occurrence of intrathoracic kidney associated with Bochdalek hernia is infrequent among adult individuals and is typically an incidental finding. A 52-year-old obese female patient presented to the pulmonology outpatient unit and reported experiencing the symptoms of coughing, wheezing, and difficulty in breathing since three years. A chest radiograph revealed an elevated dome of the diaphragm on the right side. A computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a defect in the posterior aspect of the right hemi-diaphragm with herniation of the right kidney and retroperitoneal fat into the right hemi-thorax. CT urography showed normal size and enhancement of the intrathoracic kidney with prompt excretion of contrast into the pelvicalyceal system. With regard to the small size of the hernia and considering the absence of complications on CT urography, a conservative treatment was proposed to the patient. The patient was followed up every year. There was no occurrence of renal complications during the follow-up period. When evaluating patients with 'elevated hemi-diaphragm' or thoracic 'mass', it is essential to check for the presence of intrathoracic kidney to avoid undesirable surgical procedures and image-guided biopsies",PubMed
Ribosomal DNA copy number is associated with body mass in humans and other mammals,"Body mass results from a complex interplay between genetics and environment. The contribution of genetic variation to body mass has been extensively studied, but due to the technical limitations of platforms used for population scale studies, repetitive parts of the genome have not previously been considered. Here we applied genome-wide approaches to identify an association between adult body mass and the copy number (CN) of 45S-ribosomal DNA (rDNA). rDNA codes for the rRNA components of the ribosome and exists in hundreds of copies/cell in mammals. Inter-individual variation in rDNA CN has not previously been documented but has not been associated with a mammalian phenotype. Here, we show that germ-line inherited rDNA CN is associated with post-pubertal growth rate in rats and BMI in adult humans. rDNA CN variation is not associated with rRNA transcription rates in adult tissues, suggesting the mechanistic link occurs earlier in development. This is supported by our observation that it is growth rate and body mass, rather than obesity that are associated with copy number and that these phenotypes emerge prior to adulthood. We present hypotheses for future investigation into the mechanistic basis of this association",biorxiv
Genetic drift vs natural selection affecting the evolution of spectral and functional traits of two key macrophytes: Phragmites australis and Nuphar lutea,"Both genetic and phenotypic intraspecific diversity play a crucial role in the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of organisms. Several studies have compared phenotypic divergence (Pst) and differentiation of neutral loci (Fst) to infer the relative roles of genetic drift and natural selection in population differentiation (Pst - Fst comparison). For the first time, we assessed and compared the genetic variation and differentiation at the leaf trait level in two key macrophytes, Phragmites australis and Nuphar lutea.  To this aim, we quantified and described the genetic structure and phenotypic diversity of both species in five lake systems in north-central Italy. We then investigated the relative roles of genetic drift and natural selection on leaf trait differentiation (Pst - Fst), assuming that Fst reflects divergence caused only by genetic drift while Pst also incorporates the effects of selective dynamics on the phenotype.  In terms of genetic structure, the results for P. australis were in line with those observed for other Italian and European conspecific populations. Conversely, N. lutea showed a more complex genetic structure than expected at the site level, likely due to the combined effect of genetic isolation and its mixed mating system. Both species exhibited high variability in leaf functional traits within and among sites, highlighting a high degree of phenotypic plasticity. Pst - Fst comparisons showed a general tendency towards directional selection in P. australis and a more complex pattern in N. lutea. Indeed, the drivers of phenotypic differentiation in N. lutea showed a variable mix of stabilizing and directional selection or neutral divergence at most sites.  The prevalence of vegetative over generative reproduction leads P. australis populations to be dominated by a few clones that are well adapted to local conditions, including phenotypes that respond plastically to the environment. In contrast, in N. lutea the interaction of a mixed mating system and geographical isolation among distant sites tends to reduce the effect of outbreeding depression and provides the genetic basis for adaptive capacity.  The first joint analysis of the genetic structure of these two key macrophytes allowed a better understanding of the relative roles of genetic drift and natural selection in the diversification of phenotypic traits within habitats dominated by P. australis and N. lutea",biorxiv
Enhanced brain tumor diagnosis using combined deep learning models and weight selection technique,"Brain tumor classification is a critical task in medical imaging, as accurate diagnosis directly influences treatment planning and patient outcomes. Traditional methods often fall short in achieving the required precision due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of brain tumors. In this study, we propose an innovative approach to brain tumor multi-classification by leveraging an ensemble learning method that combines advanced deep learning models with an optimal weighting strategy. Our methodology integrates Vision Transformers (ViT) and EfficientNet-V2 models, both renowned for their powerful feature extraction capabilities in medical imaging. This model enhances the feature extraction step by capturing both global and local features, thanks to the combination of different deep learning models with the ViT model. These models are then combined using a weighted ensemble approach, where each model's prediction is assigned a weight. To optimize these weights, we employ a genetic algorithm, which iteratively selects the best weight combinations to maximize classification accuracy. We trained and validated our ensemble model using a well-curated dataset comprising labeled brain MRI images. The model's performance was benchmarked against standalone ViT and EfficientNet-V2 models, as well as other traditional classifiers. The ensemble approach achieved a notable improvement in classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score compared to individual models. Specifically, our model attained an accuracy rate of 95%, significantly outperforming existing methods. This study underscores the potential of combining advanced deep learning models with a genetic algorithm-optimized weighting strategy to tackle complex medical classification tasks. The enhanced diagnostic precision offered by our ensemble model can lead to better-informed clinical decisions, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, our approach can be generalized to other medical imaging classification problems, paving the way for broader applications of AI in healthcare. This advancement in brain tumor classification contributes valuable insights to the field of medical AI, supporting the ongoing efforts to integrate advanced computational tools in clinical practice",PubMed
CKD-TransBTS: Clinical Knowledge-Driven Hybrid Transformer With Modality-Correlated Cross-Attention for Brain Tumor Segmentation,"Brain tumor segmentation (BTS) in magnetic resonance image (MRI) is crucial for brain tumor diagnosis, cancer management and research purposes. With the great success of the ten-year BraTS challenges as well as the advances of CNN and Transformer algorithms, a lot of outstanding BTS models have been proposed to tackle the difficulties of BTS in different technical aspects. However, existing studies hardly consider how to fuse the multi-modality images in a reasonable manner. In this paper, we leverage the clinical knowledge of how radiologists diagnose brain tumors from multiple MRI modalities and propose a clinical knowledge-driven brain tumor segmentation model, called CKD-TransBTS. Instead of directly concatenating all the modalities, we re-organize the input modalities by separating them into two groups according to the imaging principle of MRI. A dual-branch hybrid encoder with the proposed modality-correlated cross-attention block (MCCA) is designed to extract the multi-modality image features. The proposed model inherits the strengths from both Transformer and CNN with the local feature representation ability for precise lesion boundaries and long-range feature extraction for 3D volumetric images. To bridge the gap between Transformer and CNN features, we propose a Trans&CNN Feature Calibration block (TCFC) in the decoder. We compare the proposed model with six CNN-based models and six transformer-based models on the BraTS 2021 challenge dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art brain tumor segmentation performance compared with all the competitors",PubMed
Recognition of Necrosis and Ethylene-inducing like peptides confers disease resistance in Brassica napus and is modulated by BSK1 in Arabidopsis,"Brassicas are important crops susceptible to significant losses caused by disease: thus, breeding resistant lines can mitigate the effects of pathogens. MAMPs (microbe-associated molecular patterns) are conserved molecules of pathogens that elicit host defence responses known as pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Necrosis & Ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like proteins (NLPs) are MAMPs found in a wide range of phytopathogens, including major disease-causing fungal species. We studied the response to the BcNEP2 from Botrytis cinerea as a representative NLP in Brassica napus to improve our understanding of recognition mechanisms that could enable the development of disease-resistant crops.  To genetically map regions responsible for NLP recognition, we used an associative transcriptomics (AT) approach using diverse B. napus accessions and bulk segregant analysis (BSA) on DNA pools created from a bi-parental cross of NLP-responsive (Ningyou1) and non-responsive (Ningyou7) lines. In silico mapping with AT identified two peaks associated with NLP recognition on chromosomes A04 and C05 whereas the BSA narrowed it down to a main peak on A04. BSA delimited the region associated with NLP-responsiveness to 3 Mbp, containing [~]245 genes on the Darmor-bzh reference genome. Variants detected in the region were used for KASP marker design and four KASP markers were identified co-segregating with the phenotype. The same pipeline was performed with the ZS11 genome, and the highest associated region was confirmed on chromosome A04. Comparative BLAST analysis revealed there were unannotated clusters of RLP homologs on ZS11 chromosome A04. To reduce the number of candidate genes responsible for NLP recognition, RNA-Seq data was used to detect the unannotated expressed putative genes. Screening the BSA Ning1x7 population demonstrated a highly significant association between NLP-recognition and resistance to Botrytis cinerea. Also, the lines non-responsive to NLP had significantly greater response to the bacterial MAMP flg22. Additionally, BnaA01g02190D, a homologue of Arabidopsis AtBSK1 (At4g35230) BR-SIGNALLING KINASE1, was associated with a high BcNEP2-induced ROS response phenotype. We show that in Arabidopsis, Atbsk1 mutants had significantly lower response to BcNEP2 and increased susceptibility to B. cinerea (p-value=1.12e-14***). Overall, the results define the genomic location for NLP-recognition on the B. napus genome and demonstrate that NLP recognition has a positive contribution to disease resistance which can have practical application in crop improvement",biorxiv
BioFusionNet: Deep Learning-Based Survival Risk Stratification in ER+ Breast Cancer Through Multifeature and Multimodal Data Fusion,"Breast cancer is a significant health concern affecting millions of women worldwide. Accurate survival risk stratification plays a crucial role in guiding personalised treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes. Here we present BioFusionNet, a deep learning framework that fuses image-derived features with genetic and clinical data to obtain a holistic profile and achieve survival risk stratification of ER+ breast cancer patients. We employ multiple self-supervised feature extractors (DINO and MoCoV3) pretrained on histopathological patches to capture detailed image features. These features are then fused by a variational autoencoder and fed to a self-attention network generating patient-level features. A co-dual-cross-attention mechanism combines the histopathological features with genetic data, enabling the model to capture the interplay between them. Additionally, clinical data is incorporated using a feed-forward network, further enhancing predictive performance and achieving comprehensive multimodal feature integration. Furthermore, we introduce a weighted Cox loss function, specifically designed to handle imbalanced survival data, which is a common challenge. Our model achieves a mean concordance index of 0.77 and a time-dependent area under the curve of 0.84, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. It predicts risk (high versus low) with prognostic significance for overall survival in univariate analysis (HR=2.99, 95% CI: 1.88-4.78, p 0.005), and maintains independent significance in multivariate analysis incorporating standard clinicopathological variables (HR=2.91, 95% CI: 1.80-4.68, p 0.005)

Intragraft memory-like CD127hiCD4+Foxp3+ Tregs maintain transplant tolerance,"CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an essential role in suppressing transplant rejection, but their role within the graft and heterogeneity in tolerance are poorly understood. Here, we compared phenotypic and transcriptomic characteristics of Treg populations within lymphoid organs and grafts in an islet xenotransplant model of tolerance. We showed Tregs were essential for tolerance induction and maintenance. Tregs demonstrated heterogeneity within the graft and lymphoid organs of tolerant mice. A subpopulation of CD127hi Tregs with memory features were found in lymphoid organs, presented in high proportions within long-surviving islet grafts, and had a transcriptomic and phenotypic profile similar to tissue Tregs. Importantly, these memory-like CD127hi Tregs were better able to prevent rejection by effector T cells, after adoptive transfer into secondary Rag-/- hosts, than naive Tregs or unselected Tregs from tolerant mice. Administration of IL-7 to the CD127hi Treg subset was associated with a strong activation of phosphorylation of STAT5. We proposed that memory-like CD127hi Tregs developed within the draining lymph node and underwent further genetic reprogramming within the graft toward a phenotype that had shared characteristics with other tissue or tumor Tregs. These findings suggested that engineering Tregs with these characteristics either in vivo or for adoptive transfer could enhance transplant tolerance",PubMed
Natural language processing and expert follow-up establishes tachycardia association with CDKL5 deficiency disorder,"CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with multisystemic comorbidities. Cardiovascular involvement in CDD was shown in animal models but is yet poorly described in CDD cohorts. We identified 38 individuals with genetically confirmed CDD through the Cleveland Clinic CDD specialty clinic and matched 190 individuals with non-genetic epilepsy to them as a comparison group. Natural language processing was applied to yield Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms from medical records. We conducted HPO association testing and manual chart review to explore cardiovascular comorbidities associated with CDD. We extracted 243,541 HPO terms from 30,512 medical encounters. Phenome-wide analysis confirmed well-established CDD phenotypes and identified association of tachycardia with CDD (Odds ratio 4.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75-9.93, P <sub>adj</sub> < .001). We found a 99.6-fold enrichment of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in CDD encounter notes (P <sub>adj</sub> < .001), which led to identification of 2 cases of fetal/neonatal onset SVT previously undescribed in CDD. Tachycardia in CDD individuals was associated with the presence of other autonomic symptoms (Odds ratio 5.63, 95% CI 1.08-40.3, P = .038). CDD is associated with tachycardia, potentially including early-onset SVT. Alongside prospective validation studies, semiautomated genotype-phenotype analysis with matched controls is a scalable, rapid, and efficient approach for validating known and identifying novel phenotype associations

Digital profiling of gene expression from histology images with linearized attention,"Cancer is a heterogeneous disease requiring costly genetic profiling for better understanding and management. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled cost-effective predictions of genetic alterations from whole slide images (WSIs). While transformers have driven significant progress in non-medical domains, their application to WSIs lags behind due to high model complexity and limited dataset sizes. Here, we introduce SEQUOIA, a linearized transformer model that predicts cancer transcriptomic profiles from WSIs. SEQUOIA is developed using 7584 tumor samples across 16 cancer types, with its generalization capacity validated on two independent cohorts comprising 1368 tumors. Accurately predicted genes are associated with key cancer processes, including inflammatory response, cell cycles and metabolism. Further, we demonstrate the value of SEQUOIA in stratifying the risk of breast cancer recurrence and in resolving spatial gene expression at loco-regional levels. SEQUOIA hence deciphers clinically relevant information from WSIs, opening avenues for personalized cancer management",PubMed
Silver chimaera genome assembly and identification of the holocephalan sex chromosome sequence,"Cartilaginous fishes are divided into holocephalans and elasmobranchs, and comparative studies involving them are expected to elucidate how variable phenotypes and distinctive genomic properties were established in those ancient vertebrate lineages. To date, molecular-level studies on holocephalans have concentrated on the family Callorhinchidae, with a chromosome-scale genome assembly of Callorhinchus milii available. In this study, we focused on the most species-rich holocephalan family Chimaeridae and sequenced the genome of its member, silver chimaera (Chimaera phantasma). We report the first chromosome-scale genome assembly of the Chimaeridae, with high continuity and completeness, which exhibited a large intragenomic variation of chromosome lengths, which is correlated with intron size. This pattern is observed more widely in vertebrates and at least partly accounts for cross-species genome size variation. A male-female comparison identified a silver chimaera genomic scaffold with a double sequence depth for females, which we identify as an X chromosome fragment. This is the first DNA sequence-based evidence of a holocephalan sex chromosome, suggesting a male heterogametic sex determination system. This study, allowing the first chromosome-level comparison among holocephalan genomes, will trigger in-depth understanding of the genomic diversity among vertebrates as well as species population genetic structures based on the genome assembly of high completeness",biorxiv
Multi-view graph learning for deciphering the dominant cell communication assembly of downstream functional events from single-cell RNA-seq data,"Cell-cell communications (CCCs) from multiple sender cells collaboratively affect downstream functional events in receiver cells, thus influencing cell phenotype and function. How to rank the importance of these CCCs and find the dominant ones in a specific downstream functional event has great significance for deciphering various physiological and pathogenic processes. To date, several computational methods have been developed to focus on the identification of cell types that communicate with enriched ligand-receptor interactions from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, but to the best of our knowledge, all of them lack the ability to identify the communicating cell type pairs that play a major role in a specific downstream functional event, which we call it ""dominant cell communication assembly (DCA)"". Here, we proposed scDCA, a multi-view graph learning method for deciphering DCA from scRNA-seq data. scDCA is based on a multi-view CCC network by constructing different cell type combinations at single-cell resolution. Multi-view graph convolution network was further employed to reconstruct the expression pattern of target genes or the functional states of receiver cells. The DCA was subsequently identified by interpreting the model with the attention mechanism. scDCA was verified in a real scRNA-seq cohort of advanced renal cell carcinoma, accurately deciphering the DCA that affect the expression patterns of the critical immune genes and functional states of malignant cells. Furthermore, scDCA also accurately explored the alteration in cell communication under clinical intervention by comparing the DCA for certain cytotoxic factors between patients with and without immunotherapy. scDCA is free available at: https://github.com/pengsl-lab/scDCA.git",biorxiv
scDCA: deciphering the dominant cell communication assembly of downstream functional events from single-cell RNA-seq data,"Cell-cell communications (CCCs) involve signaling from multiple sender cells that collectively impact downstream functional processes in receiver cells. Currently, computational methods are lacking for quantifying the contribution of pairwise combinations of cell types to specific functional processes in receiver cells (e.g. target gene expression or cell states). This limitation has impeded understanding the underlying mechanisms of cancer progression and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Here, we proposed a deep learning-based method, scDCA, to decipher the dominant cell communication assembly (DCA) that have a higher impact on a particular functional event in receiver cells from single-cell RNA-seq data. Specifically, scDCA employed a multi-view graph convolution network to reconstruct the CCCs landscape at single-cell resolution, and then identified DCA by interpreting the model with the attention mechanism. Taking the samples from advanced renal cell carcinoma as a case study, the scDCA was successfully applied and validated in revealing the DCA affecting the crucial gene expression in immune cells. The scDCA was also applied and validated in revealing the DCA responsible for the variation of 14 typical functional states of malignant cells. Furthermore, the scDCA was applied and validated to explore the alteration of CCCs under clinical intervention by comparing the DCA for certain cytotoxic factors between patients with and without immunotherapy. In summary, scDCA provides a valuable and practical tool for deciphering the cell type combinations with the most dominant impact on a specific functional process of receiver cells, which is of great significance for precise cancer treatment.

"Central precocious puberty: a review of diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes","Central precocious puberty (CPP) refers to early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and is manifested by breast development in girls or testicular enlargement in boys before the normal physiological age ranges. CPP can be precipitated by intracranial pathology, exposure to high levels of sex steroids, or environmental risk factors, but most cases are idiopathic. Monogenic causes have also been identified. In this Review, we summarise pathophysiology, risk factors, diagnosis, and management of CPP. Concern for CPP should prompt referral to paediatric endocrinology where diagnosis is confirmed by clinical, biochemical, radiological, and genetic testing. CPP is treated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue, the primary aims of which are to increase adult height and postpone development of secondary sexual characteristics to an age that is more commensurate with peers. Although long-term outcomes of treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues are reassuring, additional research on the psychological effect of CPP is needed",PubMed
Multiomic analyses implicate a neurodevelopmental program in the pathogenesis of cerebral arachnoid cysts,"Cerebral arachnoid cysts (ACs) are one of the most common and poorly understood types of developmental brain lesion. To begin to elucidate AC pathogenesis, we performed an integrated analysis of 617 patient-parent (trio) exomes, 152,898 human brain and mouse meningeal single-cell RNA sequencing transcriptomes and natural language processing data of patient medical records. We found that damaging de novo variants (DNVs) were highly enriched in patients with ACs compared with healthy individuals (P = 1.57 × 10<sup>-33</sup>). Seven genes harbored an exome-wide significant DNV burden. AC-associated genes were enriched for chromatin modifiers and converged in midgestational transcription networks essential for neural and meningeal development. Unsupervised clustering of patient phenotypes identified four AC subtypes and clinical severity correlated with the presence of a damaging DNV. These data provide insights into the coordinated regulation of brain and meningeal development and implicate epigenomic dysregulation due to DNVs in AC pathogenesis. Our results provide a preliminary indication that, in the appropriate clinical context, ACs may be considered radiographic harbingers of neurodevelopmental pathology warranting genetic testing and neurobehavioral follow-up. These data highlight the utility of a systems-level, multiomics approach to elucidate sporadic structural brain disease",PubMed
Large language models assisted multi-effect variants mining on cerebral cavernous malformation familial whole genome sequencing,"Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a polygenic disease with intricate genetic interactions contributing to quantitative pathogenesis across multiple factors. The principal pathogenic genes of CCM, specifically KRIT1, CCM2, and PDCD10, have been reported, accompanied by a growing wealth of genetic data related to mutations. Furthermore, numerous other molecules associated with CCM have been unearthed. However, tackling such massive volumes of unstructured data remains challenging until the advent of advanced large language models. In this study, we developed an automated analytical pipeline specialized in single nucleotide variants (SNVs) related biomedical text analysis called BRLM. To facilitate this, BioBERT was employed to vectorize the rich information of SNVs, while a deep residue network was used to discriminate the classes of the SNVs. BRLM was initially constructed on mutations from 12 different types of TCGA cancers, achieving an accuracy exceeding 99%. It was further examined for CCM mutations in familial sequencing data analysis, highlighting an upstream master regulator gene fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1). With multi-omics characterization and validation in biological function, FGF1 demonstrated to play a significant role in the development of CCMs, which proved the effectiveness of our model. The BRLM web server is available at http://1.117.230.196",PubMed
Cryopreservation of cerebrospinal fluid cells preserves transcriptomics integrity for single-cell analysis,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) matrix biomarkers have become increasingly valuable surrogate markers of neuropsychiatric diseases in research and clinical practice. In contrast, CSF cells have been rarely investigated due to their relative scarcity and fragility, and lack of common collection and cryopreservation protocols, with limited exceptions for neurooncology and primary immune-based diseases like multiple sclerosis. the advent of a microfluidics-based multi-omics approaches to studying individual cells has allowed for the study of cellular phenotyping, intracellular dynamics, and intercellular relationships that provide multidimensionality unable to be obtained through acellular fluid-phase analyses. challenges to cell-based research include site-to-site differences in handling, storage, and thawing methods, which can lead to inaccuracy and inter-assay variability. In the present study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (10x Genomics) on fresh or previously cryopreserved human CSF samples from three alternative cryopreservation methods: Fetal Bovine Serum with Dimethyl sulfoxide (FBS/DMSO), FBS/DMSO after a DNase step (a step often included in epigenetic studies), and cryopreservation using commercially available Recovery(C) media. In comparing relative differences between fresh and cryopreserved samples, we found little effect of the cryopreservation method on being able to resolve donor-linked cell type proportions, markers of cellular stress, and overall gene expression at the single-cell level, whereas donor-specific differences were readily discernable. We further demonstrate the compatibility of fresh and cryopreserved CSF immune cell sequencing using biologically relevant sexually dimorphic gene expression differences by donor. Our findings support the utility and interchangeability of FBS/DMSO and Recovery cryopreservation with fresh sample analysis, providing a methodological grounding that will enable researchers to further expand our understanding of the CSF immune cell contributions to neurological and psychiatric disease",biorxiv
Clinical Outcome Assessments and Biomarkers in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) encompasses a diverse group of genetic forms of inherited peripheral neuropathy and stands as the most common hereditary neurologic disease worldwide. At present, no disease-modifying treatments exist for any form of CMT. However, promising therapeutic strategies are rapidly emerging, necessitating careful consideration of clinical outcome assessments (COAs) and clinical trial design. In this review, we discuss the challenges and successes over the past 2 decades in efforts to design and validate COAs and disease biomarkers of CMT. Natural history studies and completed clinical trials have underscored the limitations of early clinical scales for CMT, including the neuropathy impairment score, overall neuropathy limitation scale, and CMT neuropathy score. These studies prompted the development of newer, psychometrically supported scales including the CMT neuropathy score version 2, CMT pediatric scale, CMT infant scale, CMT functional outcome measure, and CMT health index. Although promising, many of these scales have yet to be formally tested in longitudinal studies. Given inherent challenges of relying solely on COAs in slowly progressive forms of CMT, there is growing recognition of the need for objective disease biomarkers that could serve as surrogate end points in clinical trials. Among these, MRI muscle fat fraction in the lower extremities has proven the most responsive biomarker to date, although its relationship to functional outcomes and its performance in treatment trials remain uncertain. Serum biomarkers including neurofilament light, transmembrane protease serine 5, specific microRNAs, neural cell adhesion molecule 1, and growth and differentiation factor 15 reliably distinguish patients with CMT from controls, but their responsiveness to effective therapies also remains unknown. Although the optimal combination of outcome measures in CMT has yet to be established, many of the most promising COAs and biomarkers are now being put to the test in ongoing clinical trials. These early studies will also help address other critical clinical trial considerations, such as patient selection and enrollment targets, which will become increasingly important in this exciting new era of bringing the first disease-modifying treatments to people living with CMT",PubMed
Assessment of ChatGPT's performance on neurology written board examination questions,"ChatGPT has shown promise in healthcare. To assess the utility of this novel tool in healthcare education, we evaluated ChatGPT's performance in answering neurology board exam questions. Neurology board-style examination questions were accessed from BoardVitals, a commercial neurology question bank. ChatGPT was provided a full question prompt and multiple answer choices. First attempts and additional attempts up to three tries were given to ChatGPT to select the correct answer. A total of 560 questions (14 blocks of 40 questions) were used, although any image-based questions were disregarded due to ChatGPT's inability to process visual input. The artificial intelligence (AI) answers were then compared with human user data provided by the question bank to gauge its performance. Out of 509 eligible questions over 14 question blocks, ChatGPT correctly answered 335 questions (65.8%) on the first attempt/iteration and 383 (75.3%) over three attempts/iterations, scoring at approximately the 26th and 50th percentiles, respectively. The highest performing subjects were pain (100%), epilepsy & seizures (85%) and genetic (82%) while the lowest performing subjects were imaging/diagnostic studies (27%), critical care (41%) and cranial nerves (48%). This study found that ChatGPT performed similarly to its human counterparts. The accuracy of the AI increased with multiple attempts and performance fell within the expected range of neurology resident learners. This study demonstrates ChatGPT's potential in processing specialised medical information. Future studies would better define the scope to which AI would be able to integrate into medical decision making",PubMed
Finding the sweet spot: a qualitative study exploring patients' acceptability of chatbots in genetic service delivery,"Chatbots, web-based artificial intelligence tools that simulate human conversation, are increasingly in use to support many areas of genomic medicine. However, patient preferences towards using chatbots across the range of clinical settings are unknown. We conducted a qualitative study with individuals who underwent genetic testing for themselves or their child. Participants were asked about their preferences for using a chatbot within the genetic testing journey. Thematic analysis employing interpretive description was used. We interviewed 30 participants (67% female, 50% 50 + years). Participants considered chatbots to be inefficient for very simple tasks (e.g., answering FAQs) or very complex tasks (e.g., explaining results). Chatbots were acceptable for moderately complex tasks where participants perceived a favorable return on their investment of time and energy. In addition to achieving this ""sweet spot,"" participants anticipated that their comfort with chatbots would increase if the chatbot was used as a complement to but not a replacement for usual care. Participants wanted a ""safety net"" (i.e., access to a clinician) for needs not addressed by the chatbot. This study provides timely insights into patients' comfort with and perceived limitations of chatbots for genomic medicine and can inform their implementation in practice",PubMed
Global hypomethylation in childhood asthma identified by genome-wide DNA-methylation sequencing preferentially affects enhancer regions,"Childhood asthma is a result of a complex interaction of genetic and environmental components causing epigenetic and immune dysregulation, airway inflammation and impaired lung function. Although different microarray based EWAS studies have been conducted, the impact of epigenetic regulation in asthma development is still widely unknown. We have therefore applied unbiased whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to characterize global DNA-methylation profiles of asthmatic children compared to healthy controls. Peripheral blood samples of 40 asthmatic and 42 control children aged 5-15 years from three birth cohorts were sequenced together with paired cord blood samples. Identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were categorized in genotype-associated, cell-type-dependent, or prenatally primed. Network analysis and subsequent natural language processing of DMR-associated genes was complemented by targeted analysis of functional translation of epigenetic regulation on the transcriptional and protein level. In total, 158 DMRs were identified in asthmatic children compared to controls of which 37% were related to the eosinophil content. A global hypomethylation was identified affecting predominantly enhancer regions and regulating key immune genes such as IL4, IL5RA, and EPX. These DMRs were confirmed in n = 267 samples and could be linked to aberrant gene expression. Out of the 158 DMRs identified in the established phenotype, 56 were perturbed already at birth and linked, at least in part, to prenatal influences such as tobacco smoke exposure or phthalate exposure. This is the first epigenetic study based on whole genome sequencing to identify marked dysregulation of enhancer regions as a hallmark of childhood asthma",PubMed
PLS3 Mutations in X-Linked Osteoporosis: Clinical and Genetic Features in Five New Families,"Childhood-onset osteoporosis is a rare but clinically significant condition. Studies have shown pathogenic variants in more than 20 different genes as causative for childhood-onset primary osteoporosis. The X-chromosomal PLS3, encoding Plastin-3, is one of the more recently identified genes. In this study, we describe five new families from four different European countries with PLS3-related skeletal fragility. The index cases were all hemizygous males presenting with long bone and vertebral body compression fractures. All patients had low lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD). The age at the first clinical fracture ranged from 1.5 to 13&nbsp;years old. Three of the identified PLS3 variants were stop-gain variants and two were deletions involving either a part or all exons of the gene. In four families the variant was inherited from the mother. All heterozygous women reported here had normal BMD and no bone fractures. Four patients received bisphosphonate treatment with good results, showing a lumbar spine BMD increment and vertebral body reshaping after 10 months to 2 years of treatment. Our findings expand the genetic spectrum of PLS3-related osteoporosis. Our report also shows that early treatment with bisphosphonates may influence the disease course and reduce the progression of osteoporosis, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis for prompt intervention and appropriate genetic counseling",PubMed
Synaptic-dependent developmental dysconnectivity in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,"Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion is among the strongest known genetic risk factors for neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. Brain imaging studies have reported disrupted large-scale functional connectivity in people with 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). However, the significance and biological determinants of these functional alterations remain unclear. Here, we use a cross-species design to investigate the developmental trajectory and neural underpinnings of brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS. We find that LgDel mice, an established mouse model of 22q11DS, exhibit age-specific patterns of functional MRI (fMRI) dysconnectivity, with widespread fMRI hyper-connectivity in juvenile mice reverting to focal hippocampal hypoconnectivity over puberty. These fMRI connectivity alterations are mirrored by co-occurring developmental alterations in dendritic spine density, and are both transiently normalized by developmental GSK3{beta} inhibition, suggesting a synaptic origin for this phenomenon. Notably, analogous hyper-to hypoconnectivity reconfiguration occurs also in human 22q11DS, where it affects hippocampal and cortical regions spatially enriched for synaptic genes that interact with GSK3{beta}, and autism-relevant transcripts. Functional dysconnectivity in somatomotor components of this network is predictive of age-dependent social alterations in 22q11.2 deletion carriers. Taken together, these findings suggest that synaptic-related mechanisms underlie developmentally mediated functional dysconnectivity in 22q11DS",biorxiv
ChromTR: chromosome detection in raw metaphase cell images via deformable transformers,"Chromosome karyotyping is a critical way to diagnose various hematological malignancies and genetic diseases, of which chromosome detection in raw metaphase cell images is the most critical and challenging step. In this work, focusing on the joint optimization of chromosome localization and classification, we propose ChromTR to accurately detect and classify 24 classes of chromosomes in raw metaphase cell images. ChromTR incorporates semantic feature learning and class distribution learning into a unified DETR-based detection framework. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic Feature Learning Network (SFLN) for semantic feature extraction and chromosome foreground region segmentation with object-wise supervision. Next, we construct a Semantic-Aware Transformer (SAT) with two parallel encoders and a Semantic-Aware decoder to integrate global visual and semantic features. To provide a prediction with a precise chromosome number and category distribution, a Category Distribution Reasoning Module (CDRM) is built for foreground-background objects and chromosome class distribution reasoning. We evaluate ChromTR on 1404 newly collected R-band metaphase images and the public G-band dataset AutoKary2022. Our proposed ChromTR outperforms all previous chromosome detection methods with an average precision of 92.56% in R-band chromosome detection, surpassing the baseline method by 3.02%. In a clinical test, ChromTR is also confident in tackling normal and numerically abnormal karyotypes. When extended to the chromosome enumeration task, ChromTR also demonstrates state-of-the-art performances on R-band and G-band two metaphase image datasets. Given these superior performances to other methods, our proposed method has been applied to assist clinical karyotype diagnosis",PubMed
Multimodal predictions of end stage chronic kidney disease from asymptomatic individuals for discovery of genomic biomarkers,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a complex condition where the kidneys are damaged and progressively lose their ability to filter blood, 10% of the world population have the disease that often goes undetected until it is too late for intervention. Using the UK Biobank (UKBB) we constructed a CKD cohort of patients (n=46,986) with genomic, clinical and demographic data available, a subset (n=2,151) having also whole body Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. We used this multimodal cohort to successfully predict, from initially healthy patients, their 5-year outcomes for End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD, n=210, AUC=0.804 {+/-} 0.03 with 5 fold cross-validation) and the larger cohort for validation to predict time-to ESRD and perform Genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Extracting important clinical, phenotypic and genetic features from the models, we were able to stratify the cohorts based on a novel set of significant previously unreported SNPs related to mitochondria/cell death, kidney development and function. In particular, we show that the risk allele of SNP rs1383063 present in 30% of the population irrespective of ancestry and putatively regulating MAGI-1, a gene expressed in the podocyte slit diaphragm, is a strong predictor of ESRD and stratifies male populations of older age",medrxiv
High clinical burden of classical homocystinuria in the United States: a retrospective analysis,"Classical homocystinuria (HCU) is a rare genetic metabolic disorder resulting in elevated homocysteine and methionine levels. The clinical characteristics and associated complications of HCU are well documented. However, there is limited published research on the clinical burden of patients with HCU, especially stratified by total homocysteine (tHcy) levels. This study aimed to describe the overall clinical burden of patients with HCU in the United States and key clinical events by tHcy levels using administrative claims data. This non-interventional retrospective cohort analysis from January 01, 2016, through September 30, 2021, used Optum's de-identified Market Clarity Data. Patients who had 1 or more International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code for homocystinuria (E72.11) or the signs, disease, and symptoms term homocystinuria in the natural language processing dataset were included. To obtain a study population most likely to have HCU, stratifications by tHcy levels, clinical characteristics, and phenotypic expressions were applied to refine the cohort. Included patients were then stratified by highest tHcy level. Clinical burden was measured by category of HCU-related events. Descriptive statistics were reported. Six hundred thirty-three patients met the inclusion criteria, and 601 patients had a tHcy level: < 50 µM (n = 278), 50 to < 100 µM (n = 212), and ≥ 100 µM (n = 111). Among the 601 patients with a tHcy level, almost one-half (n = 297, 49.4%) had at least one thrombotic/thromboembolic, skeletal, ocular, or neurological event and 14.1% (n = 85) had multiple events. Thrombotic/thromboembolic events (n = 186, 30.9%) were the most common type of events, followed by skeletal (n = 100, 16.6%), ocular (n = 63, 10.5%), and neurological events (n = 50, 8.3%). During follow-up, 5.7% (n = 34) of the patients died. All events assessed were more prevalent in the 50 to < 100 µM group and ≥ 100 µM group compared with those in the < 50 µM group. As has been believed, patients with tHcy ≥ 100 µM carried a substantial clinical burden, but the burden is also very high in those whose levels were ≥ 50 µM. Thrombotic/thromboembolic events were more common than skeletal, ocular, or neurological events. Meaningfully lowered tHcy levels may help to reduce significant clinical events",PubMed
DNA methylation shows footprints of altitude selection in the clonal plant species Fragaria vesca,"Climate change poses a significant threat to plant species, potentially pushing them beyond their adaptive capacities. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, have emerged as a key candidate mechanism enabling plants to quickly adapt to environmental changes by generating locally adapted phenotypes. These phenotypic changes can be even inherited across multiple generations, thus potentially becoming targets of natural selection. However, whether natural selection can act on these epialleles has hardly been tested directly. Addressing this knowledge gap is crucial as population survival may heavily rely on DNA methylation, especially in scenarios with restricted genetic diversity, such as within clonal plant populations.  Here, we employed population genomics approaches on seven natural populations of the clonal species wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca) distributed across an altitudinal range to investigate the presence of epigenetic sites under altitude-driven selection. Our genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic analyses found a wide intra- and inter-population epigenetic diversity despite a considerably low genetic diversity. We identified heritable epialleles exhibiting signs of positive selection related to altitude, i.e. reduced intrapopulation epigenetic diversity and increased epigenetic divergence between low and high altitude. These altitude-selected epigenetic loci overlapped with genes involved in biological processes such as DNA repair, molecular recognition, regulation of gene expression, and chromatin structure. Interestingly, some of these epialleles were independent of genetic variation, suggesting they may have arisen stochastically or in response to environmental variation.  These findings suggest that heritable epigenetic variation could help clonal species quickly adapt to environmental challenges as those related to varying altitudes and/or temperatures.  Significance statementThe eventuality of epigenetic marks being inherited has led the scientific community to rethink evolution and adaptation, debating whether epigenetic information could be considered as the ""fifth base"". However, direct evidence supporting that epigenetic marks are under evolutionary processes such as natural selection remain scarce. To address this knowledge gap, we screened natural populations of wild strawberries and searched for footprints of altitudinal selection on epi-alleles. We found loci matching the criteria for epigenetic selection, i.e. reduced epigenetic diversity in populations, increased epigenetic divergence between populations of different altitudes and transmission to the (clonal) progeny. Some of these selected epi-alleles were not associated with any genetic variant, suggesting that epigenetic marks are another layer of substrate for selection to act",biorxiv
Development of a culturally targeted chatbot to inform living kidney donor candidates of African ancestry about APOL1 genetic testing: a mixed methods study,"Clinical chatbots are increasingly used to help integrate genetic testing into clinical contexts, but no chatbot exists for Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) genetic testing of living kidney donor (LKD) candidates of African ancestry. Our study aimed to culturally adapt and assess perceptions of the Gia® chatbot to help integrate APOL1 testing into LKD evaluation. Ten focus groups and post-focus group surveys were conducted with 54 LKDs, community members, and kidney transplant recipients of African ancestry. Data were analyzed through thematic analysis and descriptive statistics. Key themes about making Gia culturally targeted included ensuring: (1) transparency by providing Black LKDs' testimonials, explaining patient privacy and confidentiality protections, and explaining how genetic testing can help LKD evaluation; (2) content is informative by educating Black LKDs about APOL1 testing instead of aiming to convince them to undergo testing, presenting statistics, and describing how genetic discrimination is legally prevented; and (3) content avoids stigma about living donation in the Black community. Most agreed Gia was neutral and unbiased (82%), trustworthy (82%), and words, phrases, and expressions were familiar to the intended audience (85%). Our culturally adapted APOL1 Gia chatbot was well regarded. Future research should assess how this chatbot could supplement provider discussion prior to genetic testing to scale APOL1 counseling and testing for LKD candidate clinical evaluation",PubMed
Leveraging Large Language Models for Decision Support in Personalized Oncology,"Clinical interpretation of complex biomarkers for precision oncology currently requires manual investigations of previous studies and databases. Conversational large language models (LLMs) might be beneficial as automated tools for assisting clinical decision-making. To assess performance and define their role using 4 recent LLMs as support tools for precision oncology. This diagnostic study examined 10 fictional cases of patients with advanced cancer with genetic alterations. Each case was submitted to 4 different LLMs (ChatGPT, Galactica, Perplexity, and BioMedLM) and 1 expert physician to identify personalized treatment options in 2023. Treatment options were masked and presented to a molecular tumor board (MTB), whose members rated the likelihood of a treatment option coming from an LLM on a scale from 0 to 10 (0, extremely unlikely; 10, extremely likely) and decided whether the treatment option was clinically useful. Number of treatment options, precision, recall, F1 score of LLMs compared with human experts, recognizability, and usefulness of recommendations. For 10 fictional cancer patients (4 with lung cancer, 6 with other; median [IQR] 3.5 [3.0-4.8] molecular alterations per patient), a median (IQR) number of 4.0 (4.0-4.0) compared with 3.0 (3.0-5.0), 7.5 (4.3-9.8), 11.5 (7.8-13.0), and 13.0 (11.3-21.5) treatment options each was identified by the human expert and 4 LLMs, respectively. When considering the expert as a criterion standard, LLM-proposed treatment options reached F1 scores of 0.04, 0.17, 0.14, and 0.19 across all patients combined. Combining treatment options from different LLMs allowed a precision of 0.29 and a recall of 0.29 for an F1 score of 0.29. LLM-generated treatment options were recognized as AI-generated with a median (IQR) 7.5 (5.3-9.0) points in contrast to 2.0 (1.0-3.0) points for manually annotated cases. A crucial reason for identifying AI-generated treatment options was insufficient accompanying evidence. For each patient, at least 1 LLM generated a treatment option that was considered helpful by MTB members. Two unique useful treatment options (including 1 unique treatment strategy) were identified only by LLM. In this diagnostic study, treatment options of LLMs in precision oncology did not reach the quality and credibility of human experts; however, they generated helpful ideas that might have complemented established procedures. Considering technological progress, LLMs could play an increasingly important role in assisting with screening and selecting relevant biomedical literature to support evidence-based, personalized treatment decisions",PubMed
Enhancing Biomarker-Based Oncology Trial Matching Using Large Language Models,"Clinical trials are an essential component of drug development for new cancer treatments, yet the information required to determine a patients eligibility for enrollment is scattered in large amounts of unstructured text. Genomic biomarkers are especially important in precision medicine and targeted therapies, making them essential for matching patients to appropriate trials. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for extracting this information from clinical trial data, aiding both physicians and patients in identifying suitable matches. In this study, we explore various LLM strategies for extracting genetic biomarkers from oncology trials to improve patient enrollment rates. Our results show that open-source language models, when applied out-of-the-box, effectively capture complex logical expressions and structure genomic biomarkers in disjunctive normal form, outperforming closed-source models such as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo. Furthermore, fine-tuning these open-source models with additional data significantly enhances their performance",biorxiv
The Nucleotide Transformer: Building and Evaluating Robust Foundation Models for Human Genomics,"Closing the gap between measurable genetic information and observable traits is a longstanding challenge in genomics. Yet, the prediction of molecular phenotypes from DNA sequences alone remains limited and inaccurate, often driven by the scarcity of annotated data and the inability to transfer learning between prediction tasks. Here, we present an extensive study of foundation models pre-trained on DNA sequences, named the Nucleotide Transformer, ranging from 50M up to 2.5B parameters and integrating information from 3,202 diverse human genomes, as well as 850 genomes selected across diverse phyla, including both model and non-model organisms. These transformer models yield transferable, context-specific representations of nucleotide sequences, which allow for accurate molecular phenotype prediction even in low-data settings. We show that the developed models can be fine-tuned at low cost and despite low available data regime to solve a variety of genomics applications. Despite no supervision, the transformer models learned to focus attention on key genomic elements, including those that regulate gene expression, such as enhancers. Lastly, we demonstrate that utilizing model representations can improve the prioritization of functional genetic variants. The training and application of foundational models in genomics explored in this study provide a widely applicable stepping stone to bridge the gap of accurate molecular phenotype prediction from DNA sequence. Code and weights available on GitHub in Jax and HuggingFace in Pytorch. Example notebooks to apply these models to any downstream task are available on HuggingFace",biorxiv
Rapid measurement and machine learning classification of color vision deficiency,"Color vision deficiencies (CVDs) indicate potential genetic variations and can be important biomarkers of acquired impairment in many neuro-ophthalmic diseases. However, CVDs are typically measured with insensitive or inefficient tools that are designed to classify dichromacy subtypes rather than track changes in sensitivity. We introduce FInD (Foraging Interactive D-prime), a novel computer-based, generalizable, rapid, self-administered vision assessment tool and applied it to color vision testing. This signal detection theory-based adaptive paradigm computes test stimulus intensity from d-prime analysis. Stimuli were chromatic gaussian blobs in dynamic luminance noise, and participants clicked on cells that contain chromatic blobs (detection) or blob pairs of differing colors (discrimination). Sensitivity and repeatability of FInD Color tasks were compared against HRR, FM100 hue tests in 19 color-normal and 18 color-atypical, age-matched observers. Rayleigh color match was completed as well. Detection and Discrimination thresholds were higher for atypical observers than for typical observers, with selective threshold elevations corresponding to unique CVD types. Classifications of CVD type and severity via unsupervised machine learning confirmed functional subtypes. FInD tasks reliably detect CVD and may serve as valuable tools in basic and clinical color vision science",medrxiv
Detecting microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer using Transformer-based colonoscopy image classification and retrieval,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major global health concern, with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) being a defining characteristic of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome and affecting 15% of sporadic CRCs. Tumors with MSI-H have unique features and better prognosis compared to MSI-L and microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors. This study proposed establishing a MSI prediction model using more available and low-cost colonoscopy images instead of histopathology. The experiment utilized a database of 427 MSI-H and 1590 MSS colonoscopy images and vision Transformer (ViT) with different feature training approaches to establish the MSI prediction model. The accuracy of combining pre-trained ViT features was 84% with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86, which was better than that of DenseNet201 (80%, 0.80) in the experiment with support vector machine. The content-based image retrieval (CBIR) approach showed that ViT features can obtain a mean average precision of 0.81 compared to 0.79 of DenseNet201. ViT reduced the issues that occur in convolutional neural networks, including limited receptive field and gradient disappearance, and may be better at interpreting diagnostic information around tumors and surrounding tissues. By using CBIR, the presentation of similar images with the same MSI status would provide more convincing deep learning suggestions for clinical use",PubMed
The application of Large Language Models to the phenotype-based prioritization of causative genes in rare disease patients,"Computational methods for identifying gene-disease associations can use both genomic and phenotypic information to prioritize genes and variants that may be associated with genetic diseases. Phenotype-based methods commonly rely on comparing phenotypes observed in a patient with a database of genotype-to-phenotype associations using a measure of semantic similarity, and are primarily limited by the quality and completeness of this database as well as the quality of phenotypes assigned to a patient. Genotype-to-phenotype associations used by these methods are largely derived from literature and coded using phenotype ontologies. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been trained on large amounts of text and have shown their potential to answer complex questions across multiple domains. Here, we demonstrate that LLMs can prioritize disease-associated genes as well, or better than, dedicated bioinformatics methods relying on calculated phenotype similarity. The LLMs use only natural language information as background knowledge and do not require ontology-based phenotyping or structured genotype-to-phenotype knowledge. We use a cohort of undiagnosed patients with rare diseases and show that LLMs can be used to provide diagnostic support that helps in identifying plausible candidate genes",medrxiv
Anti-inflammatory immunomodulation for the treatment of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a rare disease where the diaphragm does not develop properly altering lung development with no established therapy. We have analyzed the effect of anti-inflammatory immunomodulators that influence macrophage activation in animal CDH models. In the widely-used nitrofen-induced model of CDH in pregnant rats, administration of a single dose of atypical Toll-like Receptors TLR2/4 dual ligands (CS1 and CS2), 3 days after nitrofen, cured diaphragmatic hernia in 73 % of the fetuses, repaired the lesion with complete diaphragm closure. Moreover, they also improve pulmonary hypoplasia and vessel hypertrophy, enhancing pulmonary maturity of fetuses. CS1 treatment also rescued the CDH phenotype in the G2-GATA4Cre;Wt1fl/fl CDH genetic mice model. Only 1 out 11 mutant embryos showed CDH after CS1 administration, whereas CDH prevalence was 70% in untreated mutant embryos. Mechanistically, CS1 stimulated the infiltration of repairing M2 macrophages (CD206+ and Arg1+) into the damaged diaphragm and reduced T cell infiltration. Alteration in retinoic acid pathways a have been also implicated in the etiology of CDH. TLR2/4 dual ligands also induced retinol pathway genes, including RBP1, RALDH2, RAR and RAR{beta}, in the affected lungs and the diaphragm and in macrophages in vitro. The present results place atypical TLR2/4 ligands as a promising solution for CDH, where the own immune system of the fetus is responsible for repairing the hernia/damage in the diaphragm, ensuring the correct positioning and development of all organs",biorxiv
A conserved role for ALG10/ALG10B and the N-glycosylation pathway in the sleep-epilepsy axis,"Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) comprise a class of inborn errors of metabolism resulting from pathogenic variants in genes coding for enzymes involved in the asparagine-linked glycosylation of proteins. Unexpectedly to date, no CDG has been described for ALG10, encoding the alpha-1,2-glucosyltransferase catalyzing the final step of lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of human traits in the UK Biobank revealed significant SNP associations with short sleep duration, reduced napping frequency, later sleep timing and evening diurnal preference as well as cardiac traits at a genomic locus containing a pair of paralogous enzymes ALG10 and ALG10B. Modeling Alg10 loss in Drosophila, we identify an essential role for the N-glycosylation pathway in maintaining appropriate neuronal firing activity, healthy sleep, preventing seizures, and cardiovascular homeostasis. We further confirm the broader relevance of neurological findings associated with Alg10 from humans and flies using zebrafish and nematodes and demonstrate conserved biochemical roles for N-glycosylation in Arabidopsis. We report a human subject homozygous for variants in both ALG10 and ALG10B arising from a consanguineous marriage, with epilepsy, brain atrophy, and sleep abnormalities as predicted by the fly phenotype. Quantitative glycoproteomic analysis in our Drosophila model identifies potential key molecular targets for neurological symptoms of CDGs",medrxiv
Dose escalation pre-clinical trial of novel Dok7-AAV in mouse model of DOK7 congenital myasthenia,"Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a group of inherited disorders characterised by defective neuromuscular transmission and fatigable muscle weakness. Mutations in DOK7, a gene encoding a post-synaptic protein crucial in the formation and stabilisation of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), rank among the leading three prevalent causes of CMS in diverse populations globally. The majority of DOK7 CMS patients experience varying degrees of disability despite receiving optimised treatment, necessitating the development of improved therapeutic approaches. Here we executed a dose escalation pre-clinical trial using a DOK7-CMS mouse model to assess the efficacy of Amp-101, an innovative AAV gene replacement therapy. Amp-101 is based on AAVrh74 and contains human DOK7 cDNA under the control of a muscle-restricted promoter. We show that at doses 6x1013vg/kg and 1x1014 vg/kg, Amp-101 generated enlarged NMJs and rescued the very severe phenotype of the model. Treated mice became at least as strong as WT littermates and the diaphragm and tibialis anterior muscles displayed robust expression of DOK7. This data suggests that Amp-101 is a promising candidate to move forward to clinic trials",biorxiv
NexToU: Efficient Topology-Aware U-Net for Medical Image Segmentation,"Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformer variants have emerged as the leading medical image segmentation backbones. Nonetheless, due to their limitations in either preserving global image context or efficiently processing irregular shapes in visual objects, these backbones struggle to effectively integrate information from diverse anatomical regions and reduce inter-individual variability, particularly for the vasculature. Motivated by the successful breakthroughs of graph neural networks (GNN) in capturing topological properties and non-Euclidean relationships across various fields, we propose NexToU, a novel hybrid architecture for medical image segmentation. NexToU comprises improved Pool GNN and Swin GNN modules from Vision GNN (ViG) for learning both global and local topological representations while minimizing computational costs. To address the containment and exclusion relationships among various anatomical structures, we reformulate the topological interaction (TI) module based on the nature of binary trees, rapidly encoding the topological constraints into NexToU. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets (including distinct imaging dimensions, disease types, and imaging modalities) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) architectures. All the code is publicly available at https://github.com/PengchengShi1220/NexToU",arXiv
Changes in social behaviour with alterations of MAPK3 and KCTD13/CUL3 pathways in two new outbred rat models for the 16p11.2 syndromes with autism spectrum disorders,"Copy number variations (CNVs) of the human 16p11.2 locus are associated with several developmental/neurocognitive syndromes. Particularly, deletion and duplication of this genetic interval are found in patients with autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability and other psychiatric traits. The high gene density associated with the region and the strong phenotypic variability of incomplete penetrance, make the study of the 16p11.2 syndromes extremely complex. To systematically study the effect of 16p11.2 CNVs and identify candidate genes and molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology, mouse models were generated previously and showed learning and memory, and to some extent social deficits. To go further in understanding the social deficits caused by 16p11.2 syndromes, we engineered deletion and duplication of the homologous region to the human 16p11.2 genetic interval in two rat outbred strains, Sprague Dawley (SD) and Long Evans (LE). The 16p11.2 rat models displayed convergent defects in social behaviour and only a few cognitive defects. Interestingly major pathways affecting MAPK3 and CUL3 were found altered in the rat 16p11.2 models with additional changes in males compared to females. Altogether, the consequences of the 16p11.2 genetic region dosage on social behaviour are now found in three different species: humans, mice and rats. In addition, the rat models pointed to sexual dimorphism, with lower severity of phenotypes in rat females compared to male mutants. This phenomenon is also observed in humans. We are convinced that the two rat models will be key to further investigating social behaviour and understanding the brain mechanisms and specific brain regions that are key to controlling social behaviour",biorxiv
Pneumonia-Induced Thyroid Crisis With Thyrotoxicosis Exacerbation: De Novo Graves' Disease Presentation on a Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS),"Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects multiple organ systems and is characterized by distinctive facial features, growth retardation, and developmental disabilities. The syndrome is caused by mutations in genes (NIPBL, RAD21, SMC3, HDAC8, and SMC1A) involved in the cohesin complex, which plays a critical role in chromosome segregation and gene expression regulation. Clinical findings typically include dysmorphic facial features (arched eyebrows, synophrys, long eyelashes, ptosis, long philtrum, thin upper lip, and posteriorly rotated ears), growth and mental retardation, upper limb defects (clinodactyly and limb deficiencies), gastrointestinal complications (gastroesophageal reflux, pyloric stenosis, diaphragmatic hernia, malrotation, and volvulus), and heart defects (ventricular and atrial septal defects). In addition, chronic respiratory tract infections including sinusitis and pneumonia have been frequently described in this population. The early recognition and diagnosis of CdLS through genetic testing are crucial to ensure appropriate medical management and early intervention therapies to improve the outcomes of affected individuals. The thyroid gland is not affected by this congenital disease, but complications can arrive in this organ by other disease-related organ malfunctions. Pneumonia-induced thyroiditis is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur in patients with underlying thyroid disease who also develop pneumonia. The symptoms are due to the hypermetabolic state induced by excess thyroid hormones and include weight loss, heat intolerance, and palpitations. There are many different causes of thyrotoxicosis. It is important to determine the cause since treatment is based on the underlying etiology. The diagnosis of pneumonia-induced thyrotoxicosis can be challenging as symptoms may mimic other conditions and laboratory testing may not always provide a clear answer. The diagnosis is confirmed with low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and elevated free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein. The management of the condition involves prompt recognition, supportive care, and the use of medications to lower thyroid hormone levels, such as beta-blockers, antithyroid drugs, steroids, and iodine. In severe cases, plasmapheresis or thyroidectomy may be necessary",PubMed
Automatic facial axes standardization of 3D fetal ultrasound images,"Craniofacial anomalies indicate early developmental disturbances and are usually linked to many genetic syndromes. Early diagnosis is critical, yet ultrasound (US) examinations often fail to identify these features. This study presents an AI-driven tool to assist clinicians in standardizing fetal facial axes/planes in 3D US, reducing sonographer workload and facilitating the facial evaluation. Our network, structured into three blocks-feature extractor, rotation and translation regression, and spatial transformer-processes three orthogonal 2D slices to estimate the necessary transformations for standardizing the facial planes in the 3D US. These transformations are applied to the original 3D US using a differentiable module (the spatial transformer block), yielding a standardized 3D US and the corresponding 2D facial standard planes. The dataset used consists of 1180 fetal facial 3D US images acquired between weeks 20 and 35 of gestation. Results show that our network considerably reduces inter-observer rotation variability in the test set, with a mean geodesic angle difference of 14.12$^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 18.27$^{\circ}$ and an Euclidean angle error of 7.45$^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 14.88$^{\circ}$. These findings demonstrate the network's ability to effectively standardize facial axes, crucial for consistent fetal facial assessments. In conclusion, the proposed network demonstrates potential for improving the consistency and accuracy of fetal facial assessments in clinical settings, facilitating early evaluation of craniofacial anomalies",arXiv
Fully Autonomous Programming with Large Language Models,"Current approaches to program synthesis with Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a ""near miss syndrome"": they tend to generate programs that semantically resemble the correct answer (as measured by text similarity metrics or human evaluation), but achieve a low or even zero accuracy as measured by unit tests due to small imperfections, such as the wrong input or output format. This calls for an approach known as Synthesize, Execute, Debug (SED), whereby a draft of the solution is generated first, followed by a program repair phase addressing the failed tests. To effectively apply this approach to instruction-driven LLMs, one needs to determine which prompts perform best as instructions for LLMs, as well as strike a balance between repairing unsuccessful programs and replacing them with newly generated ones. We explore these trade-offs empirically, comparing replace-focused, repair-focused, and hybrid debug strategies, as well as different template-based and model-based prompt-generation techniques. We use OpenAI Codex as the LLM and Program Synthesis Benchmark 2 as a database of problem descriptions and tests for evaluation. The resulting framework outperforms both conventional usage of Codex without the repair phase and traditional genetic programming approaches",arXiv
Deep learning predicts DNA methylation regulatory variants in specific brain cell types and enhances fine mapping for brain disorders,"DNA methylation (DNAm) is essential for brain development and function and potentially mediates the effects of genetic risk variants underlying brain disorders. We present INTERACT, a transformer-based deep learning model to predict regulatory variants impacting DNAm levels in specific brain cell types, leveraging existing single-nucleus DNAm data from the human brain. We show that INTERACT accurately predicts cell type-specific DNAm profiles, achieving an average area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.98 across cell types. Furthermore, INTERACT predicts cell type-specific DNAm regulatory variants, which reflect cellular context and enrich the heritability of brain-related traits in relevant cell types. Importantly, we demonstrate that incorporating predicted variant effects and DNAm levels of CpG sites enhances the fine mapping for three brain disorders-schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer's disease-and facilitates mapping causal genes to particular cell types. Our study highlights the power of deep learning in identifying cell type-specific regulatory variants, which will enhance our understanding of the genetics of complex traits

MethylGPT: a foundation model for the DNA methylome,"DNA methylation serves as a powerful biomarker for disease diagnosis and biological age assessment. However, current analytical approaches often rely on linear models that cannot capture the complex, context-dependent nature of methylation regulation. Here we present MethylGPT, a transformer-based foundation model trained on 226,555 (154,063 after QC and deduplication) human methylation profiles spanning diverse tissue types from 5,281 datasets, curated 49,156 CpG sites, and 7.6 billion training tokens. MethylGPT learns biologically meaningful representations of CpG sites, capturing both local genomic context and higher-order chromosomal features without external supervision. The model demonstrates robust methylation value prediction (Pearson R=0.929) and maintains stable performance in downstream tasks with up to 70% missing data. Applied to age prediction across multiple tissue types, MethylGPT achieves superior accuracy compared to existing methods. Analysis of the models attention patterns reveals distinct methylation signatures between young and old samples, with differential enrichment of developmental and aging-associated pathways. When finetuned to mortality and disease prediction across 60 major conditions using 18,859 samples from Generation Scotland, MethylGPT achieves robust predictive performance and enables systematic evaluation of intervention effects on disease risks, demonstrating potential for clinical applications. Our results demonstrate that transformer architectures can effectively model DNA methylation patterns while preserving biological interpretability, suggesting broad utility for epigenetic analysis and clinical applications

A ubiquitous mobile genetic element disarms a bacterial antagonist of the gut microbiota,"DNA transfer is ubiquitous in the gut microbiota, especially among species of Bacteroidales. In silico analyses have revealed hundreds of mobile genetic elements shared between these species, yet little is known about the phenotypes they encode, their effects on fitness, or pleiotropic consequences for the recipients genome. Here, we show that acquisition of a ubiquitous integrative and conjugative element encoding an antagonistic system shuts down the native contact-dependent antagonistic system of Bacteroides fragilis. Despite inactivating the native antagonism system, mobile element acquisition increases fitness of the B. fragilis transconjugant over its progenitor by arming it with a new weapon. This DNA transfer causes the strain to change allegiances so that it no longer targets ecosystem members containing the same element yet is armed for communal defense",biorxiv
Semi-Automated Data Curation from Biomedical Literature,"Data curation is a bottleneck for many informatics pipelines. A specific example of this is aggregating data from preclinical studies to identify novel genetic pathways for atherosclerosis in humans. This requires extracting data from published mouse studies such as the perturbed gene and its impact on lesion sizes and plaque inflammation, which is non-trivial. Curation efforts are resource-heavy, with curators manually extracting data from hundreds of publications. In this work, we describe the development of a semi-automated curation tool to accelerate data extraction. We use natural language processing (NLP) methods to auto-populate a web-based form which is then reviewed by a curator. We conducted a controlled user study to evaluate the curation tool. Our NLP model has a 70% accuracy on categorical fields and our curation tool accelerates task completion time by 49% compared to manual curation",PubMed
On the use of kinship and familiarity associated social information in mediating Drosophila melanogaster oviposition decisions,"Decisions where an individual lays their eggs are important, as the choice may affect their offsprings survival and lifetime reproductive success. Information produced by conspecifics can potentially be useful in decision-making as this ""social information"" may provide an energetically cheaper means of assessing oviposition site suitability rather than acquiring it personally. However, as not all public information may be equally beneficial, cues produced by kin may be especially valuable as they might signal suitable microenvironments, and are associated with other fitness advantages resulting from improved foraging success and/or a decreased risk of competition/cannibalism compared to sites where unrelated conspecifics are located. Using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, we explored whether public information use is associated with kin-based egg-laying decisions. Kinship is potentially recognized in several ways, including environmentally-associated proxy cues, so we explored whether there were biases in how focal females interacted with cues from conspecifics that differed in both genetic relatedness, and environmental ""familiarity."" In a series of inter-connected assays, we examined the behaviour of focal females that interacted with a choice of potential egg-laying substrates that differed in the manner of their prior conspecific exposure, and counted the offspring that eclosed from these different substrates. Sites that had exhibited cues produced by conspecific demonstrators were visited more, and yielded more focal offspring compared to unexposed substrates. Furthermore, patterns of bias in offspring production were consistent with ovipositing females exhibiting sensitivity to the kinship status of the prior substrates occupants. The basis of the kinship categorization by ovipositing females appears to be based on phenotypes that reflect true genetic relatedness, but the nature of the social information can be affected by other factors. These results further highlight the potential usefulness of D. melanogaster as a model to understand the evolution of social behaviour in the expression of decision-making",biorxiv
Enhancing Recognition and Interpretation of Functional Phenotypic Sequences through Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Genomic Models,"Decoding high-quality human genomic sequences requires comprehensive analysis of DNA sequence functionality. Through computational and experimental approaches, researchers study the genotype-phenotype relationship and generate important datasets that help unravel complicated genetic blueprints. This study explores the use of deep learning, particularly pre-trained models like DNA_bert_6 and human_gpt2-v1, in interpreting and representing human genome sequences. We meticulously construct multiple datasets linking genotypes and phenotypes to fine-tune pre-trained models for precise DNA sequence classification. Furthermore, we specifically focused on the human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) dataset with commendable classification performance (both binary and multi-classification accuracy and F1 values above 0.935 and 0.888, respectively). We evaluate the influence of sequence length on classification results and analyze the impact of feature extraction in the models hidden layers using the HERV dataset. To further understand the phenotype-specific patterns learned by the model, we perform enrichment, pathogenicity and conservation analyzes of specific motifs in the HERV sequence with high average local representation weight (LRAW) scores. Overall, the generated datasets further provide numerous additional genotype-phenotype datasets for evaluating the performance of genomic models. The findings highlight the potential of large models in learning DNA sequence representations, particularly when utilizing the HERV dataset, and provide valuable insights for future research. This work represents an innovative strategy that combines pre-trained model representations with classical omics methods for analyzing the functionality of genome sequences, fostering cross-fertilization between genomics and advanced AI.

De Novo Generation of Chemical Structures of Inhibitor and Activator Candidates for Therapeutic Target Proteins by a Transformer-Based Variational Autoencoder and Bayesian Optimization,"Deep generative models for molecular generation have been gaining much attention as structure generators to accelerate drug discovery. However, most previously developed methods are chemistry-centric approaches, and comprehensive biological responses in the cell have not been taken into account. In this study, we propose a novel computational method, TRIOMPHE-BOA (transcriptome-based inference and generation of molecules with desired phenotypes using the Bayesian optimization algorithm), to generate new chemical structures of inhibitor or activator candidates for therapeutic target proteins by integrating chemically and genetically perturbed transcriptome profiles. In the algorithm, the substructures of multiple molecules that were selected based on the transcriptome analysis are fused in the design of new chemical structures by exploring the latent space of a Transformer-based variational autoencoder using Bayesian optimization. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method in terms of having high reproducibility of existing ligands for 10 therapeutic target proteins when compared with previous methods. Moreover, this method can be applied to proteins without detailed 3D structures or known ligands and is expected to become a powerful tool for more efficient hit identification",PubMed
TSCA-Net: Transformer based spatial-channel attention segmentation network for medical images,"Deep learning architectures based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer have achieved great success in medical image segmentation. Models based on the encoder-decoder framework like U-Net have been successfully employed in many realistic scenarios. However, due to the low contrast between object and background, various shapes and scales of objects, and complex background in medical images, it is difficult to locate targets and obtain better segmentation performance by extracting effective information from images. In this paper, an encoder-decoder architecture based on spatial and channel attention modules built by Transformer is proposed for medical image segmentation. Concretely, spatial and channel attention modules based on Transformer are utilized to extract spatial and channel global complementary information at different layers in U-shape network, which is beneficial to learn the detail features in different scales. To fuse better spatial and channel information from Transformer features, a spatial and channel feature fusion block is designed for the decoder. The proposed network inherits the advantages of both CNN and Transformer with the local feature representation and long-range dependency for medical images. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms against eight state-of-the-art segmentation methods on five publicly medical image datasets including different modalities, such as 80.23% and 93.56% Dice value, 67.13% and 88.94% Intersection over Union (IoU) value on the Multi-organ Nucleus Segmentation (MoNuSeg) and Combined Healthy Abdominal Organ Segmentation with Computed Tomography scans (CHAOS-CT) datasets",PubMed
Mouse-Geneformer: A Deep Learning Model for Mouse Single-Cell Transcriptome and Its Cross-Species Utility,"Deep learning techniques are increasingly utilized to analyze large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, offering valuable insights from complex transcriptome datasets. Geneformer, a pre-trained model using a Transformer Encoder architecture and human scRNA-seq datasets, has demonstrated remarkable success in human transcriptome analysis. However, given the prominence of the mouse, Mus musculus, as a primary mammalian model in biological and medical research, there is an acute need for a mouse-specific version of Geneformer. In this study, we developed a mouse-specific Geneformer (mouse-Geneformer) by constructing a large transcriptome dataset consisting of 21 million mouse scRNA-seq profiles and pre-training Geneformer on this dataset. The mouse-Geneformer effectively models the mouse transcriptome and, upon fine-tuning for downstream tasks, enhances the accuracy of cell type classification. In silico perturbation experiments using mouse-Geneformer successfully identified disease-causing genes that have been validated in in vivo experiments. These results demonstrate the feasibility of analyzing mouse data with mouse-Geneformer and highlight the robustness of the Geneformer architecture, applicable to any species with large-scale transcriptome data available. Furthermore, we found that mouse-Geneformer can analyze human transcriptome data in a cross-species manner. After the ortholog-based gene name conversion, the analysis of human scRNA-seq data using mouse-Geneformer, followed by fine-tuning with human data, achieved cell type classification accuracy comparable to that obtained using the original human Geneformer. In in silico simulation experiments using human disease models, we obtained results similar to human-Geneformer for the myocardial infarction model but only partially consistent results for the COVID-19 model, a trait unique to humans (laboratory mice are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2). These findings suggest the potential for cross-species application of the Geneformer model while emphasizing the importance of species-specific models for capturing the full complexity of disease mechanisms. Despite the existence of the original Geneformer tailored for humans, human research could benefit from mouse-Geneformer due to its inclusion of samples that are ethically or technically inaccessible for humans, such as embryonic tissues and certain disease models. Additionally, this cross-species approach indicates potential use for non-model organisms, where obtaining large-scale single-cell transcriptome data is challenging.  Author SummaryResearchers have developed Geneformer, a powerful tool that utilizes advanced deep learning techniques and large-scale single-cell transcriptome data to analyze human cell genetic activity. However, given the extensive use of mice (Mus musculus) in medical and biology research, there is a need for a similar tool tailored to this model organism. To address this gap, we developed mouse-Geneformer, an adaptation of Geneformer trained on a large dataset of mouse single-cell RNA sequencing data obtained from 20 million cells. Mouse-Geneformer demonstrates high accuracy in identifying distinct cell types and predicting disease-causing genes in gene manipulation simulation experiments. Moreover, mouse-Geneformer exhibited comparable accuracy to the original human Geneformer, even when applied to human cell data, suggesting its potential for cross-species use. For instance, it performed well in studying heart disease but was less consistent with COVID-19, likely due to the differences between species in how they react to the virus. Overall, mouse-Geneformer could be a valuable resource for studying not only mice but also other animals, especially when large-scale data are challenging to obtain. Furthermore, this cross-species approach may probe beneficial in human research, especially for tissues that are difficult to access, such as embryonic samples",biorxiv
Prescreening in oncology trials using medical records. Natural language processing applied on lung cancer multidisciplinary team meeting reports,"Defining profiles of patients that could benefit from relevant anti-cancer treatments is essential. An increasing number of specific criteria are necessary to be eligible to specific anti-cancer therapies. This study aimed to develop an automated algorithm able to detect patient and tumor characteristics to reduce the time-consuming prescreening for trial inclusions without delay. Hence, 640 anonymized multidisciplinary team meetings (MTM) reports concerning lung cancers from one French teaching hospital data warehouse between 2018 and 2020 were annotated. To automate the extraction of eight major eligibility criteria, corresponding to 52 classes, regular expressions were implemented. The RegEx's evaluation gave a F1-score of 93% in average, a positive predictive value (precision) of 98% and sensitivity (recall) of 92%. However, in MTM, fill rates variabilities among patient and tumor information remained important (from 31% to 100%). Genetic mutations and rearrangement test results were the least reported characteristics and also the hardest to automatically extract. To ease prescreening in clinical trials, the PreScIOUs study demonstrated the additional value of rule based and machine learning based methods applied on lung cancer MTM reports",PubMed
From Text to Translation: Using Language Models to Prioritize Variants for Clinical Review,"Despite rapid advances in genomic sequencing, most rare genetic variants remain insufficiently characterized for clinical use, limiting the potential of personalized medicine. When classifying whether a variant is pathogenic, clinical labs adhere to diagnostic guidelines that comprehensively evaluate many forms of evidence including case data, computational predictions, and functional screening. While a substantial amount of clinical evidence has been developed for these variants, the majority cannot be definitively classified as  pathogenic or  benign, and thus persist as  Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS). We processed over 2.4 million plaintext variant summaries from ClinVar, employing sentence-level classification to remove content that does not contain evidence and removing uninformative summaries. We developed ClinVar-BERT to discern clinical evidence within these summaries by fine-tuning a BioBERT-based model with labeled records. When validated classifications from this model against orthogonal functional screening data, ClinVar-BERT significantly separated estimates of functional impact in clinically actionable genes, including BRCA1 (p = 1.90 x 10-20), TP53 (p = 1.14 x 10-47), and PTEN (p = 3.82 x 10-7). Additionally, ClinVar-BERT achieved an AUROC of 0.927 in classifying ClinVar VUS against this functional screening data. This suggests that ClinVar-BERT is capable of discerning evidence from diagnostic reports and can be used to prioritize variants for re-assessment by diagnostic labs and expert curation panels

Currently, commonly used methods like next-generation sequencing (NGS) identifyKRASmutations but are expensive, time-consuming, and may not be suitable for every cancer patient sample. To address these challenges, we have developedKRASFormer, a novel framework that predictsKRASgene mutations from Haematoxylin and Eosin (H & E) stained WSIs that are widely available for most CRC patients.KRASFormerconsists of two stages: the first stage filters out non-tumor regions and selects only tumour cells using a quality screening mechanism, and the second stage predicts theKRASgene either wildtype' or mutant' using a Vision Transformer-based XCiT method. The XCiT employs cross-covariance attention to capture clinically meaningful long-range representations of textural patterns in tumour tissue andKRASmutant cells. We evaluated the performance of the first stage using an independent CRC-5000 dataset, and the second stage included both The Cancer Genome Atlas colon and rectal cancer (TCGA-CRC-DX) and in-house cohorts. The results of our experiments showed that the XCiT outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving AUCs for ROC curves of 0.691 and 0.653 on TCGA-CRC-DX and in-house datasets, respectively. Our findings emphasize three key consequences: the potential of using H & E-stained tissue slide images for predictingKRASgene mutations as a cost-effective and time-efficient means for guiding treatment choice with CRC patients; the increase in performance metrics of a Transformer-based model; and the value of the collaboration between pathologists and data scientists in deriving a morphologically meaningful model",PubMed
Using ChatGPT to Predict Cancer Predisposition Genes: A Promising Tool for Pediatric Oncologists,"Determining genetic susceptibility for cancer predisposition syndromes (CPS) through cancer predisposition genes (CPGs) testing is critical in facilitating appropriate prevention and surveillance strategies. This study investigates the use of ChatGPT, a large language model, in predicting CPGs using clinical notes. Our study involved 53 patients with pathogenic CPG mutations. Two kinds of clinical notes were used: the first visit note, containing a thorough history and physical exam, and the genetic clinic note, summarizing the patient's diagnosis and family history. We asked ChatGPT to recommend CPS genes based on these notes and compared these predictions with previously identified mutations. Rb1 was the most frequently mutated gene in our cohort (34%), followed by NF1 (9.4%), TP53 (5.7%), and VHL (5.7%). Out of 53 patients, 30 had genetic clinic notes of a median length of 54 words. ChatGPT correctly predicted the gene in 93% of these cases. However, it failed to predict EPCAM and VHL genes in specific patients. For the first visit notes (median length: 461 words), ChatGPT correctly predicted the gene in 64% of these cases. ChatGPT shows promise in predicting CPGs from clinical notes, particularly genetic clinic notes. This approach may be useful in enhancing CPG testing, especially in areas lacking genetic testing resources. With further training, there is a possibility for ChatGPT to improve its predictive potential and expand its clinical applicability. However, additional research is needed to explore the full potential and applicability of ChatGPT",PubMed
Multi-modal deep learning improves grain yield prediction in wheat breeding by fusing genomics and phenomics,"Developing new crop varieties with superior performance is highly important to ensure robust and sustainable global food security. The speed of variety development is limited by long field cycles and advanced generation selections in plant breeding programs. While methods to predict yield from genotype or phenotype data have been proposed, improved performance and integrated models are needed. We propose a machine learning model that leverages both genotype and phenotype measurements by fusing genetic variants with multiple data sources collected by unmanned aerial systems. We use a deep multiple instance learning framework with an attention mechanism that sheds light on the importance given to each input during prediction, enhancing interpretability. Our model reaches 0.754 ± 0.024 Pearson correlation coefficient when predicting yield in similar environmental conditions; a 34.8% improvement over the genotype-only linear baseline (0.559 ± 0.050). We further predict yield on new lines in an unseen environment using only genotypes, obtaining a prediction accuracy of 0.386 ± 0.010, a 13.5% improvement over the linear baseline. Our multi-modal deep learning architecture efficiently accounts for plant health and environment, distilling the genetic contribution and providing excellent predictions. Yield prediction algorithms leveraging phenotypic observations during training therefore promise to improve breeding programs, ultimately speeding up delivery of improved varieties.

Improving Automated Deep Phenotyping Through Large Language Models Using Retrieval Augmented Generation,"Diagnosing rare genetic disorders relies on precise phenotypic and genotypic analysis, with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) providing a standardized language for capturing clinical phenotypes. Traditional HPO tools, such as Doc2HPO and ClinPhen, employ concept recognition to automate phenotype extraction but struggle with incomplete phenotype assignment, often requiring intensive manual review. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise for more context-driven phenotype extraction, they are prone to errors and ""hallucinations,"" making them less reliable without further refinement. We present RAG-HPO, a Python-based tool that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to elevate LLM accuracy in HPO term assignment, bypassing the limitations of baseline models while avoiding the time and resource intensive process of fine-tuning. RAG-HPO integrates a dynamic vector database, allowing real-time retrieval and contextual matching. The high-dimensional vector database utilized by RAG-HPO includes >54,000 phenotypic phrases mapped to HPO IDs, derived from the HPO database and supplemented with additional validated phrases. The RAG-HPO workflow uses an LLM to first extract phenotypic phrases that are then matched via semantic similarity to entries within a vector database before providing best term matches back to the LLM as context for final HPO term assignment. A benchmarking dataset of 120 published case reports with 1,792 manually-assigned HPO terms was developed, and the performance of RAG-HPO measured against existing published tools Doc2HPO, ClinPhen, and FastHPOCR. In evaluations, RAG-HPO, powered by Llama-3 70B and applied to a set of 120 case reports, achieved a mean precision of 0.84, recall of 0.78, and an F1 score of 0.80-significantly surpassing conventional tools (p<0.00001). False positive HPO term identification occurred for 15.8% (256/1,624) of terms, of which only 2.7% (7/256) represented hallucinations, and 33.6% (86/256) unrelated terms; the remainder of false positives (63.7%, 163/256) were relative terms of the target term. RAG-HPO is a user-friendly, adaptable tool designed for secure evaluation of clinical text and outperforms standard HPO-matching tools in precision, recall, and F1. Its enhanced precision and recall represent a substantial advancement in phenotypic analysis, accelerating the identification of genetic mechanisms underlying rare diseases and driving progress in genetic research and clinical genomics

Hair Shaft Disorders in Children - An Update,"Disorders of hair shaft are a diverse group of congenital and acquired abnormalities of the hair that can pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the dermatologists. Hair shaft abnormalities can occur as an isolated phenomenon or can be associated with an underlying genetic syndrome. Any change in the texture, appearance, and growth of the hair should prompt evaluation of the patient for the presence of any hair shaft anomaly. The diagnosis can be suggested by a complete history and physical examination of the hair-bearing areas as well as other ectodermal structures (nails and teeth). A key feature in the evaluation of hair shaft defects is to determine the fragility of the hair shaft that can be elucidated by performing the ""tug test."" Trichoscopy and light microscopy serve as valuable tools in establishing the specific type of hair shaft disorder. An update of the approach for the diagnosis and management is included in this review",PubMed
Multi-ancestry genome- and phenome-wide association studies of diverticular disease in electronic health records with natural language processing enriched phenotyping algorithm,"Diverticular disease (DD) is one of the most prevalent conditions encountered by gastroenterologists, affecting ~50% of Americans before the age of 60. Our aim was to identify genetic risk variants and clinical phenotypes associated with DD, leveraging multiple electronic health record (EHR) data sources of 91,166 multi-ancestry participants with a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique. We developed a NLP-enriched phenotyping algorithm that incorporated colonoscopy or abdominal imaging reports to identify patients with diverticulosis and diverticulitis from multicenter EHRs. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of DD in European, African and multi-ancestry participants, followed by phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) of the risk variants to identify their potential comorbid/pleiotropic effects in clinical phenotypes. Our developed algorithm showed a significant improvement in patient classification performance for DD analysis (algorithm PPVs ≥ 0.94), with up to a 3.5 fold increase in terms of the number of identified patients than the traditional method. Ancestry-stratified analyses of diverticulosis and diverticulitis of the identified subjects replicated the well-established associations between ARHGAP15 loci with DD, showing overall intensified GWAS signals in diverticulitis patients compared to diverticulosis patients. Our PheWAS analyses identified significant associations between the DD GWAS variants and circulatory system, genitourinary, and neoplastic EHR phenotypes. As the first multi-ancestry GWAS-PheWAS study, we showcased that heterogenous EHR data can be mapped through an integrative analytical pipeline and reveal significant genotype-phenotype associations with clinical interpretation. A systematic framework to process unstructured EHR data with NLP could advance a deep and scalable phenotyping for better patient identification and facilitate etiological investigation of a disease with multilayered data",PubMed
Integrative proteo-genomic profiling uncovers key biomarkers of lapatinib resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer,"Drug resistance is a major obstacle to the long-term effectiveness of cancer therapies. Approximately 70% of breast cancer patients relapse after 5 years of treatment, and the lack of biomarkers associated with drug resistance translates to poor prognosis in clinic. Previous research has utilised omics approaches to uncover biomarkers driving drug resistance, with a strong emphasis on genetic mutations. Here, we identified a nine-marker signature associated with resistance to lapatinib in a HER2-positive breast cancer model using a target discovery approach by employing an integrative multi-omics strategy, combining ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and proteomics. We found that 7 markers in the drug resistance-signature had not been previously found to be implicated in HER2 positive breast cancer. We counterintuitively found that drug resistant cells have restrictive chromatin accessibility with reduced gene expression associated with limited total proteome changes. However, upon closer look, we identified that the drug resistance-signature had increased chromatin accessibility closer to the transcriptional start sites of those genes and are highly differentially expressed across the three datasets. Our data show that despite the overall transcriptional and proteomic landscape showing limited changes, there are several markers that are highly expressed, which correlate with increased anchorage-independent and invasive phenotype in vitro in lapatinib resistant cells compared to cancer cells. Our results demonstrate that disease aggressiveness can be related to reduced chromatin and gene expression dynamics. We anticipate that the resistant signature identified here using integrative target discovery approach can be applied to complex, representative models and validated before they can be targeted by suitable therapeutic agents",biorxiv
A Multimodal Foundation Model for Discovering Genetic Associations with Brain Imaging Phenotypes,"Due to the intricate etiology of neurological disorders, finding interpretable associations between multi-omics features can be challenging using standard approaches. We propose COMICAL, a contrastive learning approach leveraging multi-omics data to generate associations between genetic markers and brain imaging-derived phenotypes. COMICAL jointly learns omic representations utilizing transformer-based encoders with custom tokenizers. Our modality-agnostic approach uniquely identi-fies many-to-many associations via self-supervised learning schemes and cross-modal attention encoders. COMICAL discovered several significant associations between genetic markers and imaging-derived phenotypes for a variety of neurological disorders in the UK Biobank as well as predicting across diseases and unseen clinical outcomes from the learned representations. Source code of COMICAL along with pre-trained weights, enabling transfer learning is available at https://github.com/IBM/comical",medrxiv
Illuminating the Terminal Nerve: Uncovering the Link between GnRH-1 and Olfactory Development,"During embryonic development, the olfactory placode (OP) generates migratory neurons, including olfactory pioneer neurons, cells of the terminal nerve (TN), Gonadotropin-releasing hormone-1 (GnRH-1) neurons, and other uncharacterized neurons. Pioneer neurons from the olfactory placode induce olfactory bulb morphogenesis.  In mice, GnRH-1 neurons appear in the olfactory system around mid-gestation and migrate via the terminal nerve axons to different brain regions. The GnRH-1 neurons are crucial in controlling the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Kallmann syndrome is characterized by impaired olfactory system development, defective olfactory bulbs, defective secretion of GnRH-1, and infertility. The precise mechanistic link between the olfactory system and GnRH-1 development remains unclear. Studies in humans and mice highlight the importance of the Prokineticin-2/Prokineticin-Receptor-2 (Prokr2) signaling pathway in olfactory bulb morphogenesis and GnRH-1 neuronal migration. Prokr2 loss-of-function mutations can cause Kallmann syndrome, and hence the Prokr2 signaling pathway represents a unique model to decipher the olfactory/GnRH-1 connection. We discovered that Prokr2 is expressed in the TN neurons during the critical period of GnRH-1 neuron formation, migration, and induction of olfactory bulb morphogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified that the TN is formed by neurons that are distinct from the olfactory neurons. The TN neurons express multiple genes associated with KS. Our study suggests that the aberrant development of pioneer/TN neurons might cause the KS spectrum.  Key Points1) Pioneer or terminal nerve neurons play a crucial role in initiating the development of the olfactory bulbs. We found that the Prokineticin Receptor-2 gene, associated with Kallmann syndrome, is expressed by the olfactory pioneer/terminal nerve neurons. 2) We genetically traced, isolated, and conducted Single-cell RNA sequencing on terminal nerve neurons of rodents. This analysis revealed a significant enrichment of gene expression related to Kallmann syndrome. 3) Our study indicates that the investigation of Pioneer/terminal nerve neurons should be a pivotal focal point for comprehending developmental defects affecting olfactory and GnRH-1 systems",biorxiv
Literature mining discerns latent disease-gene relationships,"Dysregulation of a gene's function, either due to mutations or impairments in regulatory networks, often triggers pathological states in the affected tissue. Comprehensive mapping of these apparent gene-pathology relationships is an ever-daunting task, primarily due to genetic pleiotropy and lack of suitable computational approaches. With the advent of high throughput genomics platforms and community scale initiatives such as the Human Cell Landscape project, researchers have been able to create gene expression portraits of healthy tissues resolved at the level of single cells. However, a similar wealth of knowledge is currently not at our finger-tip when it comes to diseases. This is because the genetic manifestation of a disease is often quite diverse and is confounded by several clinical and demographic covariates. To circumvent this, we mined ∼18 million PubMed abstracts published till May 2019 and automatically selected ∼4.5 million of them that describe roles of particular genes in disease pathogenesis. Further, we fine-tuned the pretrained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) for language modeling from the domain of natural language processing to learn vector representation of entities such as genes, diseases, tissues, cell-types, etc., in a way such that their relationship is preserved in a vector space. The repurposed BERT predicted disease-gene associations that are not cited in the training data, thereby highlighting the feasibility of in silico synthesis of hypotheses linking different biological entities such as genes and conditions.

"Gender-based research underscores sex differences in biological processes, clinical disorders and pharmacological interventions","Earlier research has presumed that the male and female biology is similar in most organs except the reproductive system, leading to major misconceptions in research interpretations and clinical implications, with serious disorders being overlooked or misdiagnosed. Careful research has now identified sex differences in the cardiovascular, renal, endocrine, gastrointestinal, immune, nervous, and musculoskeletal systems. Also, several cardiovascular, immunological, and neurological disorders have shown differences in prevalence and severity between males and females. Genetic variations in the sex chromosomes have been implicated in several disorders at young age and before puberty. The levels of the gonadal hormones estrogen, progesterone and testosterone and their receptors play a role in the sex differences between adult males and premenopausal women. Hormonal deficiencies and cell senescence have been implicated in differences between postmenopausal and premenopausal women. Specifically, cardiovascular disorders are more common in adult men vs premenopausal women, but the trend is reversed with age with the incidence being greater in postmenopausal women than age-matched men. Gender-specific disorders in females such as polycystic ovary syndrome, hypertension-in-pregnancy and gestational diabetes have attained further research recognition. Other gender-related research areas include menopausal hormone therapy, the ""Estrogen Paradox"" in pulmonary arterial hypertension being more predominant but less severe in young females, and how testosterone may cause deleterious effects in the kidney while having vasodilator effects in the coronary circulation. This has prompted the National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiative to consider sex as a biological variable in research. The NIH and other funding agencies have provided resources to establish state-of-the-art centers for women health and sex differences in biology and disease in several academic institutions. Scientific societies and journals have taken similar steps to organize specialized conferences and publish special issues on gender-based research. These combined efforts should promote research to enhance our understanding of the sex differences in biological systems beyond just the reproductive system, and provide better guidance and pharmacological tools for the management of various clinical disorders in a gender-specific manner",PubMed
Deep-GenMut: Automated genetic mutation classification in oncology: A deep learning comparative study,"Early cancer detection and treatment depend on the discovery of specific genes that cause cancer. The classification of genetic mutations was initially done manually. However, this process relies on pathologists and can be a time-consuming task. Therefore, to improve the precision of clinical interpretation, researchers have developed computational algorithms that leverage next-generation sequencing technologies for automated mutation analysis. This paper utilized four deep learning classification models with training collections of biomedical texts. These models comprise bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for Biomedical text mining (BioBERT), a specialized language model implemented for biological contexts. Impressive results in multiple tasks, including text classification, language inference, and question answering, can be obtained by simply adding an extra layer to the BioBERT model. Moreover, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), long short-term memory (LSTM), and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) have been leveraged to produce very good results in categorizing genetic mutations based on textual evidence. The dataset used in the work was created by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), which contains several mutations. Furthermore, this dataset poses a major classification challenge in the Kaggle research prediction competitions. In carrying out the work, three challenges were identified: enormous text length, biased representation of the data, and repeated data instances. Based on the commonly used evaluation metrics, the experimental results show that the BioBERT model outperforms other models with an F1 score of 0.87 and 0.850 MCC, which can be considered as improved performance compared to similar results in the literature that have an F1 score of 0.70 achieved with the BERT model",PubMed
FindZebra online search delving into rare disease case reports using natural language processing,"Early diagnosis is crucial for well-being and life quality of the rare disease patient. Access to the most complete knowledge about diseases through intelligent user interfaces can play an important role in supporting the physician reaching the correct diagnosis. Case reports may offer information about heterogeneous phenotypes which often further complicate rare disease diagnosis. The rare disease search engine FindZebra.com is extended to also access case report abstracts extracted from PubMed for several diseases. A search index for each disease is built in Apache Solr adding age, sex and clinical features extracted using text segmentation to enhance the specificity of search. Clinical experts performed retrospective validation of the search engine, utilising real-world Outcomes Survey data on Gaucher and Fabry patients. Medical experts evaluated the search results as being clinically relevant for the Fabry patients and less clinically relevant for the Gaucher patients. The shortcomings for Gaucher patients mainly reflect a mismatch between the current understanding and treatment of the disease and how it is reported in PubMed, notably in the older case reports. In response to this observation, a filter for the publication date was added in the final version of the tool available from deep.findzebra.com/<disease> with <disease> = gaucher, fabry, hae (Hereditary angioedema)",PubMed
A Feature-Fusion Technique-Based Alzheimer's Disease Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Early identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for optimal treatment and management. Deep learning (DL) technologies, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) can provide promising outcomes in AD diagnosis. However, these technologies lack model interpretability and demand substantial computational resources, causing challenges in the resource-constrained environment. Hybrid ViTs can outperform individual ViTs by visualizing key features with limited computational power. This synergy enhances feature extraction and promotes model interpretability. Thus, the authors present an innovative model for classifying AD using MRI images with limited computational resources. The authors improved the AD feature-extraction process by modifying the existing ViTs. A CatBoost-based classifier was used to classify the extracted features into multiple classes. The proposed model was generalized using the OASIS dataset. The model obtained an exceptional classification accuracy of 98.8% with a minimal loss of 0.12. The findings highlight the potential of the proposed AD classification model in providing an interpretable and resource-efficient solution for healthcare centers. To improve model robustness and applicability, subsequent research can include genetic and clinical data",PubMed
Deep structured learning for variant prioritization in Mendelian diseases,"Effective computer-aided or automated variant evaluations for monogenic diseases will expedite clinical diagnostic and research efforts of known and novel disease-causing genes. Here we introduce MAVERICK: a Mendelian Approach to Variant Effect pRedICtion built in Keras. MAVERICK is an ensemble of transformer-based neural networks that can classify a wide range of protein-altering single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels and assesses whether a variant would be pathogenic in the context of dominant or recessive inheritance. We demonstrate that MAVERICK outperforms all other major programs that assess pathogenicity in a Mendelian context. In a cohort of 644 previously solved patients with Mendelian diseases, MAVERICK ranks the causative pathogenic variant within the top five variants in over 95% of cases. Seventy-six percent of cases were solved by the top-ranked variant. MAVERICK ranks the causative pathogenic variant in hitherto novel disease genes within the first five candidate variants in 70% of cases. MAVERICK has already facilitated the identification of a novel disease gene causing a degenerative motor neuron disease. These results represent a significant step towards automated identification of causal variants in patients with Mendelian diseases",PubMed
Successful management of splenic artery dissection after sigmoid colon perforation in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a genetic disorder that causes fragility of the systemic connective tissues. Of the 13 subtypes, vascular EDS (vEDS) is associated with abnormalities in collagen production, resulting in arterial rupture and intestinal perforation. Herein, we report the case of a man with confirmed vEDS who survived a ruptured dissected splenic artery aneurysm triggered by perforation of the sigmoid colon. A 48-year-old man presented to our hospital with sudden severe lower abdominal pain. The patient was genetically diagnosed with vEDS at the age of 43 years. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed fluid and free air surrounding the sigmoid colon. These findings suggested sigmoid colon perforation, and emergency surgery was needed. Hartmann's procedure was performed. The resected specimen showed a 2-cm-sized depression around the perforation. Histopathological findings showed an abscess and exudate in the serosa of the perforation and thinning of the intrinsic muscular layer in the depressed area. The patient was doing well postoperatively; however, on the ninth postoperative day, sudden upper abdominal pain developed. CT revealed an intra-abdominal hemorrhage due to rupture of a dissecting splenic artery aneurysm. The aneurysm was not observed on preoperative CT and was distant from the surgical site. Urgent transcatheter arterial embolization was performed. Although embolization of the splenic artery was attempted during the procedure, the arterial dissection spread to the common hepatic artery. Moreover, the proper hepatic and gastroduodenal arteries were poorly visualized, probably due to vasospasm. Although complications associated with extensive embolization were a concern, embolization of the splenic and common hepatic arteries was necessary to save the patient's life. After embolization, angiography showed that the left hepatic blood flow was maintained from the inferior phrenic artery, and the right hepatic inflow was maintained from the superior mesenteric artery via the peribiliary vascular plexus in the hilar area. The patient recovered well and was discharged on the 19th postoperative day. vEDS can cause arterial rupture after intestinal surgery. Therefore, careful post-operative management is necessary. Moreover, cooperation with interventional radiologists is important for prompt treatment of vascular complications",PubMed
Echoes of Biases: How Stigmatizing Language Affects AI Performance,"Electronic health records (EHRs) serve as an essential data source for the envisioned artificial intelligence (AI)-driven transformation in healthcare. However, clinician biases reflected in EHR notes can lead to AI models inheriting and amplifying these biases, perpetuating health disparities. This study investigates the impact of stigmatizing language (SL) in EHR notes on mortality prediction using a Transformer-based deep learning model and explainable AI (XAI) techniques. Our findings demonstrate that SL written by clinicians adversely affects AI performance, particularly so for black patients, highlighting SL as a source of racial disparity in AI model development. To explore an operationally efficient way to mitigate SL's impact, we investigate patterns in the generation of SL through a clinicians' collaborative network, identifying central clinicians as having a stronger impact on racial disparity in the AI model. We find that removing SL written by central clinicians is a more efficient bias reduction strategy than eliminating all SL in the entire corpus of data. This study provides actionable insights for responsible AI development and contributes to understanding clinician behavior and EHR note writing in healthcare",arXiv
Identifying Health Risks from Family History: A Survey of Natural Language Processing Techniques,"Electronic health records include information on patients' status and medical history, which could cover the history of diseases and disorders that could be hereditary. One important use of family history information is in precision health, where the goal is to keep the population healthy with preventative measures. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques can assist with identifying information that could assist health professionals in identifying health risks before a condition is developed in their later years, saving lives and reducing healthcare costs.   We survey the literature on the techniques from the NLP field that have been developed to utilise digital health records to identify risks of familial diseases. We highlight that rule-based methods are heavily investigated and are still actively used for family history extraction. Still, more recent efforts have been put into building neural models based on large-scale pre-trained language models. In addition to the areas where NLP has successfully been utilised, we also identify the areas where more research is needed to unlock the value of patients' records regarding data collection, task formulation and downstream applications",arXiv
Genome-Wide Association Study Finds Multiple Loci Associated with Intraocular Pressure in HS Rats,"Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is influenced by environmental and genetic factors. Increased IOP is a major risk factor for most types of glaucoma, including primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Investigating the genetic basis of IOP may lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of POAG. The goal of this study was to identify genetic loci involved in regulating IOP using outbred heterogeneous stock (HS) rats. HS rats are a multigenerational outbred population derived from eight inbred strains that have been fully sequenced. This population is ideal for genome-wide association studies (GWASs) owing to the accumulated recombinations among well-defined haplotypes, the relatively high allele frequencies, the accessibility to a large collection of tissue samples, and the large allelic effect size compared to human studies. Both male and female HS rats (N=1,812) were used in the study. Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to obtain ~3.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from each individual. SNP heritability for IOP in HS rats was 0.32, which agrees with other studies. We performed a GWAS for the IOP phenotype using a linear mixed model and used permutation to determine a genome-wide significance threshold. We identified three genome-wide significant loci for IOP on chromosomes 1, 5, and 16. Next, we sequenced the mRNA of 51 whole eye samples to find cis-eQTLs to aid in identification of candidate genes. We report 5 candidate genes within those loci: Tyr, Ctsc, Plekhf2, Ndufaf6 and Angpt2. Tyr, Ndufaf6 and Angpt2 genes have been previously implicated by human GWAS of IOP-related conditions. Ctsc and Plekhf2 genes represent novel findings that may provide new insight into the molecular basis of IOP. This study highlights the efficacy of HS rats for investigating the genetics of elevated IOP and identifying potential candidate genes for future functional testing.  Contribution to the field statementGlaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only known modifiable risk factor. This study describes results of the genome-wide association study (GWAS) performed in outbred rats that identifies known and novel genes involved in IOP regulation. To our knowledge, this is the first GWAS performed for IOP in a rat model. Identifying novel candidate genes in the rat model provides insight into the risk factors for glaucoma in humans and potential pharmacological targets for regulating IOP. The rat model is advantageous for studying natural variations in IOP, controlling environmental exposures, and providing easier access to tissue that can be used in phenotyping and gene expression in future studies",biorxiv
Genetic and phenotypic analysis of the virulence plasmid of a non-Shigatoxigenic enteroaggregative 	Escherichia coli O104:H4 outbreak strain,"Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli O104:H4 is best known for causing a worldwide outbreak in 2011 due to acquisition of a Shiga-like toxin alongside traditional enteroaggregative virulence traits; however, whilst the 2011 outbreak strain has been well-studied, the virulence plasmid of O104:H4 has been subjected to far less experimental analysis. In this paper, we analyse the genetic and phenotypic contribution of the pAA virulence plasmid to a non-Shigatoxigenic O104:H4 strain (1070/13) that was nonetheless implicated in a substantial UK outbreak in 2013. We find that pAA1070 is 99.95% identical across 88% of the plasmid sequence to pTY2 from the 2011 outbreak strain and has a copy number of approximately 2-3 plasmid molecules per chromosome. We demonstrate that pAA1070 carries a functional CcdAB plasmid addiction system that only marginally impacts its stability under the conditions tested and that none of the other toxin-antitoxin systems encoded by the plasmid appear to be functional, though we note a surprisingly high stability of the plasmid in vitro regardless. We demonstrate the expected contribution of pAA1070 to intestinal cell adhesion but find that it does not contribute to biofilm formation. When assessing the impact of pAA1070 on motility, we discovered a region of the O104:H4 chromosome that can be excised, abolishing motility via truncation of the fliR gene. Ultimately this work contributes to our knowledge of enteroaggregative E. coli as an important pathovar in its own right and demonstrates the complexity but necessity of experimentally characterising genuine outbreak strains rather than domesticated laboratory strains in order to understand virulence phenotypes.  IMPACT STATEMENTEnteroaggregative Escherichia coli causes severe food-borne illness in humans. One serotype, O104:H4, caused a worldwide outbreak in 2011 that infected almost 4,000 people and killed dozens. The 2011 strain contained two key virulence factors: the Shiga toxin encoded by a bacteriophage and a plasmid that encodes aggregative adherence fimbriae for adhesion to host cell surfaces. Whilst the Shiga toxin has been studied extensively, the virulence plasmid has been far less well-characterised. In this study, we characterise the plasmid of a non-Shigatoxigenic O104:H4 outbreak strain and find that it contributes to host cell adherence, as expected, and that it encodes a functional CcdAB toxin-antitoxin stability system. We also demonstrate that part of the strains chromosome can be spontaneously lost during growth in the laboratory, converting the organism from highly-motile to non-motile, and suggesting a future evolutionary route for the bacterium, as has occurred in similar enteric pathogens such as Shigella. In summary, this work contributes to our knowledge of often-neglected enteroaggregative E. coli as an important pathovar and highlights the necessity of experimentally characterising genuine outbreak strains rather than ""domesticated"" laboratory strains.  Repositories/Data SummaryThe authors confirm all supporting data, code and protocols have been provided within the article or through supplementary data files. Hybrid whole-genome sequence data is available for strains 1070/13 (accession numbers CP171474, CP171475 and CP171476) and 1070/13 pAA- (accession numbers CP171472 and CP171473).

Predicting antimicrobial resistance in E. coli with discriminative position fused deep learning classifier,"Escherichia coli (E. coli) has become a particular concern due to the increasing incidence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) observed worldwide. Using machine learning (ML) to predict E. coli AMR is a more efficient method than traditional laboratory testing. However, further improvement in the predictive performance of existing models remains challenging. In this study, we collected 1937 high-quality whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from public databases with an antimicrobial resistance phenotype and modified the existing workflow by adding an attention mechanism to enable the modified workflow to focus more on core single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may significantly lead to the development of AMR in E. coli. While comparing the model performance before and after adding the attention mechanism, we also performed a cross-comparison among the published models using random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and convolutional neural network (CNN). Our study demonstrates that the discriminative positional colors of Chaos Game Representation (CGR) images can selectively influence and highlight genome regions without prior knowledge, enhancing prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we developed an online tool (https://github.com/tjiaa/E.coli-ML/tree/main) for assisting clinicians in the rapid prediction of the AMR phenotype of E. coli and accelerating clinical decision-making",PubMed
Aberrant Platelet Aggregation as Initial Presentation of Essential Thrombocythemia: Failure of Entero-Coated Aspirin to Reduce Platelet Hyperactivation,"Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm variant characterized by excessive production of platelets. Since the most common cause of mortality and morbidity in ET patients is thrombosis, the excessive production of platelets may cause thrombotic events. However, little is known about the function of platelets in ET. We report a female patient who presented as asymptomatic, without a remarkable medical history, and ET was diagnosed after an incidental finding of moderate thrombocytosis. Notably, together with thrombocytosis, an abnormal platelet phenotype was found for the presence of a massive, rapid and spontaneous formation of aggregates and platelet hypersensitivity to subthreshold concentrations of aggregating agonists. Bone marrow histopathological examination and genetic analysis with the JAK2 (V617F) gene mutation findings confirmed the initial suspicion of ET. Although the ET patient was placed on aspirin, the persistence of the platelet hyperactivation and hyperaggregability prompted a switch in antiplatelet medication from entero-coated (EC) to plain aspirin. As result, platelet hypersensitivity to agonists and spontaneous aggregation were no longer found. Collectively, our study demonstrates that platelet function analysis could be a reliable predictor of ET and that plain aspirin should be preferred over EC aspirin to attenuate platelet hyperreactivity",PubMed
Discovery of pathogenic variants in EFEMP2 and RAG1 and undetectable fetal phenotype: A challenge of prenatal exome sequencing,"Exome sequencing in prenatal context confronts with pathogenic variants associated with phenotypes that are not detectable prenatally. A consanguineous couple was referred at 24 weeks of gestation for prenatal genetic investigations after ultrasonography findings including decreased fetal movements, hypoplastic male external genitalia, retrognathia, prefrontal edema, anomalies of the great vessels with pulmonary atresia and dilated tortuous aorta. Prenatal trio exome sequencing identified two homozygous likely pathogenic variants, i.e. a missense in EFEMP2 involved in cutis laxa and a nonsense in RAG1 involved in several types of severe combined immunodeficiency. The fetal ultrasonographic phenotype was partially compatible with previously reported prenatal presentations secondary to EFEMP2 biallelic variants, but prenatal presentations have never been reported for RAG1 related disorders because the RAG1 phenotype is undetectable during pregnancy. Both EFEMP2 and RAG1 variants were disclosed to the couple because the EFEMP2 variant was considered causative for the fetal ultrasonographic phenotype and the RAG1 variant was considered a finding of strong interest for genetic counselling and monitoring of future pregnancies following the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations about the discovery of incidental findings in fetal exome sequencing in prenatal diagnosis",PubMed
SCREENER: Streamlined collaborative learning of NER and RE model for discovering gene-disease relations,"Finding relations between genes and diseases is essential in developing a clinical diagnosis, treatment, and drug design for diseases. One successful approach for mining the literature is the document-based relation extraction method. Despite recent advances in document-level extraction of entity-entity, there remains a difficulty in understanding the relations between distant words in a document. To overcome the above limitations, we propose an AI-based text-mining model that learns the document-level relations between genes and diseases using an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we show that including a direct edge (DE) and indirect edges between genetic targets and diseases when training improves the model's performance. Such relation edges can be visualized as graphs, enhancing the interpretability of the model. For the performance, we achieved an F1-score of 0.875, outperforming state-of-the-art document-level extraction models. In summary, the SCREENER identifies biological connections between target genes and diseases with superior performance by leveraging direct and indirect target-disease relations. Furthermore, we developed a web service platform named SCREENER (Streamlined CollaboRativE lEarning of NEr and Re), which extracts the gene-disease relations from the biomedical literature in real-time. We believe this interactive platform will be useful for users to uncover unknown gene-disease relations in the world of fast-paced literature publications, with sufficient interpretation supported by graph visualizations. The interactive website is available at: https://ican.standigm.com",PubMed
An Improved Nested U-Net Network for Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization Cell Image Segmentation,"Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful cytogenetic method used to precisely detect and localize nucleic acid sequences. This technique is proving to be an invaluable tool in medical diagnostics and has made significant contributions to biology and the life sciences. However, the number of cells is large and the nucleic acid sequences are disorganized in the FISH images taken using the microscope. Processing and analyzing images is a time-consuming and laborious task for researchers, as it can easily tire the human eyes and lead to errors in judgment. In recent years, deep learning has made significant progress in the field of medical imaging, especially the successful application of introducing the attention mechanism. The attention mechanism, as a key component of deep learning, improves the understanding and interpretation of medical images by giving different weights to different regions of the image, enabling the model to focus more on important features. To address the challenges in FISH image analysis, we combined medical imaging with deep learning to develop the SEAM-Unet++ automated cell contour segmentation algorithm with integrated attention mechanism. The significant advantage of this algorithm is that it improves the accuracy of cell contours in FISH images. Experiments have demonstrated that by introducing the attention mechanism, our method is able to segment cells that are adherent to each other more efficiently",PubMed
Inducible FAK Deletion but not FAK Inhibition in Endothelial Cells Activates p53 to Suppress Tumor Growth in PYK2-null Mice,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) functions as a signaling and scaffolding protein within endothelial cells (ECs) impacting blood vessel function and tumor growth. Interpretations of EC FAK-null phenotypes are complicated by related PYK2 (protein tyrosine kinase 2) expression, and to test this, we created PYK2-/- FAKfl/fl mice with tamoxifen-inducible EC-specific Cre recombinase expression. At 11 weeks of age, EC FAK inactivation resulted in increased heart and lung mass and vascular leakage only on a PYK2-/- background. Surprisingly, [~]90% of PYK2-/- EC FAK-/- mice survived to 75 weeks of age. Syngeneic melanoma, breast, or lung carcinoma tumors did not grow in PYK2-/- EC FAK-/- mice, but tumors grew normally in PYK2-/- EC FAKfl/fl mice lacking Cre. This tumor inhibitory phenotype was associated with abortive EC vessel sprouting, enhanced EC p53 tumor suppressor and p21CIP1 (cyclin-dependent inhibitor 1) expression, and alterations in serum cytokine levels. To discern the role of FAK kinase versus scaffolding activity in ECs, we generated kinase defective (FAK K454R, KD) PYK2-/- EC FAKfl/KD and PYK2-/- EC FAKfl/WT (WT, wildtype) mice. Hemizygous EC FAK-/KD expression supported primary tumor growth but not metastasis, implicating EC FAK activity in tumor dissemination. In vitro, hemizygous expression of either WT or KD FAK suppressed EC p21CIP1 levels and cell death observed in primary PYK2-/- EC FAK-/- ECs. Combined FAK and PYK2 knockdown in tumor cells also increased p21CIP1 and PARP1 (poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1) levels in a p53-associated manner impacting anchorage-independent growth. Together, these results underscore the linkage between PYK2 and FAK loss with p53 activation impacting tumor growth.  Impact StatementPYK2-null combined with endothelial cell-specific FAK transgenic mouse models show that loss of FAK activity limits tumor spread and that genetic or chemical degradation preventing combined FAK-PYK2 expression may be an approach to induce a p53-associated anti-tumor response",biorxiv
CPAE: Contrastive predictive autoencoder for unsupervised pre-training in health status prediction,"Fully-supervised learning approaches have shown promising results in some health status prediction tasks using Electronic Health Records (EHRs). These traditional approaches rely on sufficient labeled data to learn from. However, in practice, acquiring large-scaled labeled medical data for various prediction tasks is often not feasible. Thus, it is of great interest to utilize contrastive pre-training to leverage the unlabeled information. In this work, we propose a novel data-efficient framework, contrastive predictive autoencoder (CPAE), to first learn without labels from the EHR data in the pre-training process, and then fine-tune on the downstream tasks. Our framework comprises of two parts: (i) a contrastive learning process, inherited from contrastive predictive coding (CPC), which aims to extract global slow-varying features, and (ii) a reconstruction process, which forces the encoder to capture local features. We also introduce the attention mechanism in one variant of our framework to balance the above two processes. Experiments on real-world EHR dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework on two downstream tasks (i.e., in-hospital mortality prediction and length-of-stay prediction), compared to their supervised counterparts, the CPC model, and other baseline models. By comprising of both contrastive learning components and reconstruction components, CPAE aims to extract both global slow-varying information and local transient information. The best results on two downstream tasks are all achieved by CPAE. The variant AtCPAE is particularly superior when fine-tuned on very small training data. Further work may incorporate techniques of multi-task learning to optimize the pre-training process of CPAEs. Moreover, this work is based on the benchmark MIMIC-III dataset which only includes 17 variables. Future work may extend to a larger number of variables",PubMed
"Frequent transitions in mating-type locus chromosomal organization in Malassezia and early steps in sexual reproduction
==========
Genetic and genomic analysis of Malassezia reveals transitions in mating-type locus chromosomal organization and early steps in sexual reproduction","Fungi in the basidiomycete genus Malassezia are the most prevalent eukaryotic microbes resident on the skin of human and other warm-blooded animals and have been implicated in skin diseases and systemic disorders. Analysis of Malassezia genomes revealed that key adaptations to the skin microenvironment have a direct genomic basis, and the identification of mating/meiotic genes suggests a capacity to reproduce sexually, even though no sexual cycle has yet been observed. In contrast to other bipolar or tetrapolar basidiomycetes that have either two linked mating-type-determining (MAT) loci or two MAT loci on separate chromosomes, in Malassezia species studied thus far the two MAT loci are arranged in a pseudobipolar configuration (linked on the same chromosome but capable of recombining). By incorporating newly generated chromosome-level genome assemblies, and an improved Malassezia phylogeny, we infer that the pseudobipolar arrangement was the ancestral state of this group and revealed six independent transitions to tetrapolarity, seemingly driven by centromere fission or translocations in centromere- flanking regions. Additionally, in an approach to uncover a sexual cycle, Malassezia furfur strains were engineered to express different MAT alleles in the same cell. The resulting strains produce hyphae reminiscent of early steps in sexual development and display upregulation of genes associated with sexual development as well as others encoding lipases and a protease potentially relevant for pathogenesis of the fungus. Our study reveals a previously unseen genomic relocation of mating-type loci in fungi and provides insight towards the discovery of a sexual cycle in Malassezia, with possible implications for pathogenicity.  Significance StatementMalassezia, the dominant fungal group of the mammalian skin microbiome, is associated with numerous skin disorders. Sexual development and yeast-to-hyphae transitions, governed by genes at two mating-type (MAT) loci, are thought to be important for fungal pathogenicity. However, Malassezia sexual reproduction has never been observed. Here, we used chromosome-level assemblies and comparative genomics to uncover unforeseen transitions in MAT loci organization within Malassezia, possibly related with fragility of centromeric-associated regions. Additionally, by expressing different MAT alleles in the same cell, we show that Malassezia can undergo hyphal development and this phenotype is associated with increased expression of key mating genes along with other genes known to be virulence factors, providing a possible connection between hyphal development, sexual reproduction, and pathogenicity",biorxiv
AI-Enhanced Sensemaking: Exploring the Design of a Generative AI-Based Assistant to Support Genetic Professionals,"Generative AI has the potential to transform knowledge work, but further research is needed to understand how knowledge workers envision using and interacting with generative AI. We investigate the development of generative AI tools to support domain experts in knowledge work, examining task delegation and the design of human-AI interactions. Our research focused on designing a generative AI assistant to aid genetic professionals in analyzing whole genome sequences (WGS) and other clinical data for rare disease diagnosis. Through interviews with 17 genetics professionals, we identified current challenges in WGS analysis. We then conducted co-design sessions with six genetics professionals to determine tasks that could be supported by an AI assistant and considerations for designing interactions with the AI assistant. From our findings, we identified sensemaking as both a current challenge in WGS analysis and a process that could be supported by AI. We contribute an understanding of how domain experts envision interacting with generative AI in their knowledge work, a detailed empirical study of WGS analysis, and three design considerations for using generative AI to support domain experts in sensemaking during knowledge work.

Evaluating Generative AI's Ability to Identify Cancer Subtypes in Publicly Available Structured Genetic Datasets,"Genetic data play a crucial role in diagnosing and treating various diseases, reflecting a growing imperative to integrate these data into clinical care. However, significant barriers such as the structure of electronic health records (EHRs), insurance costs for genetic testing, and the interpretability of genetic results impede this integration. This paper explores solutions to these challenges by combining recent technological advances with informatics and data science, focusing on the diagnostic potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in cancer research. AI has historically been applied in medical research with limited success, but recent developments have led to the emergence of large language models (LLMs). These transformer-based generative AI models, trained on vast datasets, offer significant potential for genetic and genomic analyses. However, their effectiveness is constrained by their training on predominantly human-written text rather than comprehensive, structured genetic datasets. This study reevaluates the capabilities of LLMs, specifically GPT models, in performing supervised prediction tasks using structured gene expression data. By comparing GPT models with traditional machine learning approaches, we assess their effectiveness in predicting cancer subtypes, demonstrating the potential of AI models to analyze real-world genetic data for generating real-world evidence",PubMed
NeoGx: Machine-Recommended Rapid Genome Sequencing for Neonates,"Genetic disease is common in the Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), but neonatology providers are not always able to identify the need for genetic evaluation. We trained a machine learning (ML) algorithm to predict the need for genetic testing within the first 18 months of life using health record phenotypes. For a decade of NICU patients, we extracted Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms from clinical text with Natural Language Processing tools. Considering multiple feature sets, classifier architectures, and hyperparameters, we selected a classifier and made predictions on a validation cohort of 2,241 Level IV NICU admits born 2020-2021. Our classifier had ROC AUC of 0.87 and PR AUC of 0.73 when making predictions during the first week in the Level IV NICU. We simulated testing policies under which subjects begin testing at the time of first ML prediction, estimating diagnostic odyssey length both with and without the additional benefit of pursuing rGS at this time. Just by using ML to accelerate initial genetic testing (without changing the tests ordered), the median time to first genetic test dropped from 10 days to 1 day, and the number of diagnostic odysseys resolved within 14 days of NICU admission increased by a factor of 1.8. By additionally requiring rGS at the time of positive ML prediction, the number of diagnostic odysseys resolved within 14 days was 3.8 times higher than the baseline. ML predictions of genetic testing need, together with the application of the right rapid testing modality, can help providers accelerate genetics evaluation and bring about earlier and better outcomes for patients

Evaluating ChatGPT as an Agent for Providing Genetic Education,"Genetic disorders are complex and can greatly impact an individuals health and well-being. In this study, we assess the ability of ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI, to answer questions related to three specific genetic disorders: BRCA1, MLH1, and HFE. ChatGPT has shown it can supply articulate answers to a wide spectrum of questions. However, its ability to answer questions related to genetic disorders has yet to be evaluated. The aim of this study is to perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of ChatGPTs performance in this area. The ability of ChatGPT to provide accurate and useful information to patients was assessed by genetic experts. Here we show that ChatGPT answered 64.7% of the 68 genetic questions asked and was able to respond coherently to complex questions related to the three genes/conditions. Our results reveal that ChatGPT can provide valuable information to individuals seeking information about genetic disorders, however, it still has some limitations and inaccuracies, particularly in understanding human inheritance patterns. The results of this study have implications for both genomics and medicine and can inform future developments in this area. AI platforms, like ChatGPT, have significant potential in the field of genomics. As these technologies become integrated into consumer-facing products, appropriate oversight is required to ensure accurate and safe delivery of medical information.

Evaluation of the Rosa Chatbot Providing Genetic Information to Patients at Risk of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer: Qualitative Interview Study,"Genetic testing has become an integrated part of health care for patients with breast or ovarian cancer, and the increasing demand for genetic testing is accompanied by an increasing need for easy access to reliable genetic information for patients. Therefore, we developed a chatbot app (Rosa) that is able to perform humanlike digital conversations about genetic BRCA testing. Before implementing this new information service in daily clinical practice, we wanted to explore 2 aspects of chatbot use: the perceived utility and trust in chatbot technology among healthy patients at risk of hereditary cancer and how interaction with a chatbot regarding sensitive information about hereditary cancer influences patients. Overall, 175 healthy individuals at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer were invited to test the chatbot, Rosa, before and after genetic counseling. To secure a varied sample, participants were recruited from all cancer genetic clinics in Norway, and the selection was based on age, gender, and risk of having a BRCA pathogenic variant. Among the 34.9% (61/175) of participants who consented for individual interview, a selected subgroup (16/61, 26%) shared their experience through in-depth interviews via video. The semistructured interviews covered the following topics: usability, perceived usefulness, trust in the information received via the chatbot, how Rosa influenced the user, and thoughts about future use of digital tools in health care. The transcripts were analyzed using the stepwise-deductive inductive approach. The overall finding was that the chatbot was very welcomed by the participants. They appreciated the 24/7 availability wherever they were and the possibility to use it to prepare for genetic counseling and to repeat and ask questions about what had been said afterward. As Rosa was created by health care professionals, they also valued the information they received as being medically correct. Rosa was referred to as being better than Google because it provided specific and reliable answers to their questions. The findings were summed up in 3 concepts: ""Anytime, anywhere""; ""In addition, not instead""; and ""Trustworthy and true."" All participants (16/16) denied increased worry after reading about genetic testing and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in Rosa. Our results indicate that a genetic information chatbot has the potential to contribute to easy access to uniform information for patients at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, regardless of geographical location. The 24/7 availability of quality-assured information, tailored to the specific situation, had a reassuring effect on our participants. It was consistent across concepts that Rosa was a tool for preparation and repetition; however, none of the participants (0/16) supported that Rosa could replace genetic counseling if hereditary cancer was confirmed. This indicates that a chatbot can be a well-suited digital companion to genetic counseling",PubMed
Genetic InfoMax: Exploring Mutual Information Maximization in High-Dimensional Imaging Genetics Studies,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are used to identify relationships between genetic variations and specific traits. When applied to high-dimensional medical imaging data, a key step is to extract lower-dimensional, yet informative representations of the data as traits. Representation learning for imaging genetics is largely under-explored due to the unique challenges posed by GWAS in comparison to typical visual representation learning. In this study, we tackle this problem from the mutual information (MI) perspective by identifying key limitations of existing methods. We introduce a trans-modal learning framework Genetic InfoMax (GIM), including a regularized MI estimator and a novel genetics-informed transformer to address the specific challenges of GWAS. We evaluate GIM on human brain 3D MRI data and establish standardized evaluation protocols to compare it to existing approaches. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of GIM and a significantly improved performance on GWAS","PubMed,arXiv"
Leveraging genomic large language models to enhance causal genotype-brain-clinical pathways in Alzheimer's disease,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous Alzheimers disease (AD)- associated variants. However, how these variants contribute to the etiology of AD remains largely elusive. Recent advances in genomic large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to interpret the genetic variation observed in personal genome. In this study, we propose epiBrainLLM, a novel computational framework that leverages genomic LLM to enhance our understanding of the causal pathways from genotypes to brain measures to AD-related clinical phenotypes. epiBrainLLM will first convert the personal DNA sequence into a diverse set of genomic and epigenomic features using a pretrained genomic LLM and then use these features to further predict phenotypes. Across various experimental settings, epiBrainLLM significantly improves causal analysis compared to traditional genotype association approach. We conclude that epiBrainLLM provides a novel perspective for understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying the AD disease etiology, potentially offering insights into complex disease mechanisms beyond AD",medrxiv
Mechanistic genotype-phenotype translation using hierarchical transformers,"Genome-wide association studies have linked millions of genetic variants to biomedical phenotypes, but their utility has been limited by a lack of mechanistic understanding and widespread epistatic interactions. Recently, Transformer models have emerged as a powerful general-purpose architecture in machine learning, with potential to address these and other challenges. Accordingly, here we introduce the Genotype-to-Phenotype Transformer (G2PT), a framework for modeling hierarchical information flow among variants, genes, multigenic functions, and phenotypes. As proof-of-concept, we use G2PT to model the genetics of TG/HDL (triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), an indicator of metabolic health. G2PT learns to predict this trait via high attention to genetic variants underlying 24 functions, including immune response and cholesterol transport, with accuracy exceeding state-of-the-art. It implicates unexpected epistatic interactions, including those among APOC1 and CETP. This work positions Hierarchical Transformers as a general approach to functionally interpret polygenic risk.

"Just-DNA-Seq, open-source personal genomics platform: longevity science for everyone","Genomic data has become increasingly accessible to the general public with the advent of companies offering whole genome sequencing at a relatively low cost. However, their reports are not verifiable due to a lack of crucial details and transparency: polygenic risk scores do not always mention all the polymorphisms involved. Simultaneously, tackling the manual investigation and interpretation of data proves challenging for individuals lacking a background in genetics. Currently, there is no open-source or commercial solution that provides comprehensive longevity reports surpassing a limited number of polymorphisms. Additionally, there are no ready-made, out-of-the-box solutions available that require minimal expertise to generate reports independently. To address these issues, we have developed the Just-DNA-Seq open-source genomic platform. Just-DNA-Seq aims to provide a user-friendly solution to genome annotation by allowing users to upload their own VCF files and receive annotations of their genetic variants and polygenic risk scores related to longevity. We also created GeneticsGenie custom GPT that can answer genetics questions based on our modules. With the Just-DNA-Seq platform, we want to provide full information regarding the genetics of long life: disease-predisposing variants, that can reduce lifespan and manifest at different age (cardiovascular, oncological, neurodegenerative diseases, etc.), pro-longevity variants and longevity drug pharmacokinetics. In this research article, we will discuss the features and capabilities of Just-DNA-Seq, and how it can benefit individuals looking to understand and improve their health. It's crucial to note that the Just-DNA-Seq platform is exclusively intended for scientific and informational purposes and is not suitable for medical applications",arXiv
A transformer-based genomic prediction method fused with knowledge-guided module,"Genomic prediction (GP) uses single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to establish associations between markers and phenotypes. Selection of early individuals by genomic estimated breeding value shortens the generation interval and speeds up the breeding process. Recently, methods based on deep learning (DL) have gained great attention in the field of GP. In this study, we explore the application of Transformer-based structures to GP and develop a novel deep-learning model named GPformer. GPformer obtains a global view by gleaning beneficial information from all relevant SNPs regardless of the physical distance between SNPs. Comprehensive experimental results on five different crop datasets show that GPformer outperforms ridge regression-based linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP), support vector regression (SVR), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and deep neural network genomic prediction (DNNGP) in terms of mean absolute error, Pearson's correlation coefficient and the proposed metric consistent index. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-guided module (KGM) to extract genome-wide association studies-based information, which is fused into GPformer as prior knowledge. KGM is very flexible and can be plugged into any DL network. Ablation studies of KGM on three datasets illustrate the efficiency of KGM adequately. Moreover, GPformer is robust and stable to hyperparameters and can generalize to each phenotype of every dataset, which is suitable for practical application scenarios",PubMed
"A robust transformer-based pipeline of 3D cell alignment, denoise and instance segmentation on electron microscopy sequence images","Germline cells are critical for transmitting genetic information to subsequent generations in biological organisms. While their differentiation from somatic cells during embryonic development is well-documented in most animals, the regulatory mechanisms initiating plant germline cells are not well understood. To thoroughly investigate the complex morphological transformations of their ultrastructure over developmental time, nanoscale 3D reconstruction of entire plant tissues is necessary, achievable exclusively through electron microscopy imaging. This paper presents a full-process framework designed for reconstructing large-volume plant tissue from serial electron microscopy images. The framework ensures end-to-end direct output of reconstruction results, including topological networks and morphological analysis. The proposed 3D cell alignment, denoise, and instance segmentation pipeline (3DCADS) leverages deep learning to provide a cell instance segmentation workflow for electron microscopy image series, ensuring accurate and robust 3D cell reconstructions with high computational efficiency. The pipeline involves five stages: the registration of electron microscopy serial images; image enhancement and denoising; semantic segmentation using a Transformer-based neural network; instance segmentation through a supervoxel-based clustering algorithm; and an automated analysis and statistical assessment of the reconstruction results, with the mapping of topological connections. The 3DCADS model's precision was validated on a plant tissue ground-truth dataset, outperforming traditional baseline models and deep learning baselines in overall accuracy. The framework was applied to the reconstruction of early meiosis stages in the anthers of Arabidopsis thaliana, resulting in a topological connectivity network and analysis of morphological parameters and characteristics of cell distribution. The experiment underscores the 3DCADS model's potential for biological tissue identification and its significance in quantitative analysis of plant cell development, crucial for examining samples across different genetic phenotypes and mutations in plant development. Additionally, the paper discusses the regulatory mechanisms of Arabidopsis thaliana's germline cells and the development of stamen cells before meiosis, offering new insights into the transition from somatic to germline cell fate in plants",PubMed
Protocol for a type 3 hybrid implementation cluster randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of patient and clinician nudges to advance the use of genomic medicine across a diverse health system,"Germline genetic testing is recommended for an increasing number of conditions with underlying genetic etiologies, the results of which impact medical management. However, genetic testing is underutilized in clinics due to system, clinician, and patient level barriers. Behavioral economics provides a framework to create implementation strategies, such as nudges, to address these multi-level barriers and increase the uptake of genetic testing for conditions where the results impact medical management. Patients meeting eligibility for germline genetic testing for a group of conditions will be identified using electronic phenotyping algorithms. A pragmatic, type 3 hybrid cluster randomization study will test nudges to patients and/or clinicians, or neither. Clinicians who receive nudges will be prompted to either refer their patient to genetics or order genetic testing themselves. We will use rapid cycle approaches informed by clinician and patient experiences, health equity, and behavioral economics to optimize these nudges before trial initiation. The primary implementation outcome is uptake of germline genetic testing for the pre-selected health conditions. Patient data collected through the electronic health record (e.g. demographics, geocoded address) will be examined as moderators of the effect of nudges. This study will be one of the first randomized trials to examine the effects of patient- and clinician-directed nudges informed by behavioral economics on uptake of genetic testing. The pragmatic design will facilitate a large and diverse patient sample, allow for the assessment of genetic testing uptake, and provide comparison of the effect of different nudge combinations. This trial also involves optimization of patient identification, test selection, ordering, and result reporting in an electronic health record-based infrastructure to further address clinician-level barriers to utilizing genomic medicine. The findings may help determine the impact of low-cost, sustainable implementation strategies that can be integrated into health care systems to improve the use of genomic medicine.

Hypoxia-induced galectin-8 maintains stemness in glioma stem cells via autophagy regulation,"Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are the root cause of relapse and treatment resistance in glioblastoma (GBM). In GSCs, hypoxia in the microenvironment is known to facilitate the maintenance of stem cells, and evolutionally conserved autophagy regulates cell homeostasis to control cell population. The precise involvement of autophagy regulation in hypoxic conditions in maintaining the stemness of GSCs remains unclear. The association of autophagy regulation and hypoxia was first assessed by in silico analysis and validation in vitro. Glioma databases and clinical specimens were used to determine galectin-8 (Gal-8) expression in GSCs and human GBMs, and the regulation and function of Gal-8 in stemness maintenance were evaluated by genetic manipulation in vitro and in vivo. How autophagy was stimulated by Gal-8 under hypoxia was systematically investigated. Hypoxia enhances autophagy in GSCs to facilitate self-renewal, and Gal-8 in the galectin family is specifically involved and expressed in GSCs within the hypoxic niche. Gal-8 is highly expressed in GBM and predicts poor survival in patients. Suppression of Gal-8 prevents tumor growth and prolongs survival in mouse models of GBM. Gal-8 binds to the Ragulator-Rag complex at the lysosome membrane and inactivates mTORC1, leading to the nuclear translocation of downstream TFEB and initiation of autophagic lysosomal biogenesis. Consequently, the survival and proliferative activity of GSCs are maintained. Our findings reveal a novel Gal-8-mTOR-TFEB axis induced by hypoxia in the maintenance of GSC stemness via autophagy reinforcement, highlighting Gal-8 as a candidate for GSCs-targeted GBM therapy",PubMed
"Graph-Based Fusion of Imaging, Genetic and Clinical Data for Degenerative Disease Diagnosis","Graph learning methods have achieved noteworthy performance in disease diagnosis due to their ability to represent unstructured information such as inter-subject relationships. While it has been shown that imaging, genetic and clinical data are crucial for degenerative disease diagnosis, existing methods rarely consider how best to use their relationships. How best to utilize information from imaging, genetic and clinical data remains a challenging problem. This study proposes a novel graph-based fusion (GBF) approach to meet this challenge. To extract effective imaging-genetic features, we propose an imaging-genetic fusion module which uses an attention mechanism to obtain modality-specific and joint representations within and between imaging and genetic data. Then, considering the effectiveness of clinical information for diagnosing degenerative diseases, we propose a multi-graph fusion module to further fuse imaging-genetic and clinical features, which adopts a learnable graph construction strategy and a graph ensemble method. Experimental results on two benchmarks for degenerative disease diagnosis (Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative) demonstrate its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art graph-based methods. Our findings should help guide further development of graph-based models for dealing with imaging, genetic and clinical data",PubMed
Essential genes for Haemophilus parainfluenzae survival and biofilm growth,"Haemophilus parainfluenzae (Hp) is a Gram-negative, pleomorphic rod, highly prevalent and abundant as a commensal in the human oral cavity, and an infrequent extraoral opportunistic pathogen. Hp occupies multiple niches in the oral cavity, including the tongue dorsum, keratinized gingiva, and the supragingival plaque biofilm. As a member of the HACEK group, Hp is also known to cause infective endocarditis. Additionally, case reports have identified Hp as the causative agent of meningitis, septic arthritis, chronic osteomyelitis, septicemia, and a variety of other infectious diseases. Little is known about how Hp interacts with its neighbors in the healthy biofilm nor about its mechanisms of pathogenesis as an extraoral opportunistic pathogen. To address these unknowns, we identified the essential genomes of two Hp strains and the conditionally essential genes for their growth in in vitro biofilms aerobically and anaerobically. Using transposon insertion sequencing (TnSeq) with a highly saturated mariner transposon library in two strains, the ATCC33392 type-strain (Hp 392) and a commensal oral isolate EL1 (Hp EL1), we show that the essential genome of Hp 392 and Hp EL1 is composed of 395 and 384 genes, respectively. The core essential genome, consisting of 341 essential genes conserved between both strains, was composed of genes associated with genetic information processing, carbohydrate, protein, and energy metabolism. We also identified conditionally essential genes for aerobic and anaerobic biofilm growth, which were associated with carbohydrate and energy metabolism in both strains of Hp. Additionally, RNAseq analysis determined that most genes upregulated during anaerobic growth are not essential for Hp 392 anaerobic biofilm survival. The completion of this library and analysis under these conditions gives us a foundational insight into the basic biology of H. parainfluenzae in differing oxygen conditions, similar to its in vivo oral habitat. Further, the creation of this library presents a valuable tool for further investigation into conditionally essential genes for an organism that lives in close contact with many microbial species in the human oral habitat",biorxiv
hART: Deep learning-informed lifespan heart failure risk trajectories,"Heart failure (HF) results in persistent risk and long-term comorbidities. This is particularly true for patients with lifelong HF sequelae of cardiovascular disease such as patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). We developed hART (heart failure Attentive Risk Trajectory), a deep-learning model to predict HF trajectories in CHD patients. hART is designed to capture the contextual relationships between medical events within a patient's history. It is trained to predict future HF risk by using the masked self-attention mechanism that forces it to focus only on the most relevant segments of the past medical events. To demonstrate the utility of hART, we used a large cohort containing healthcare administrative data from the Quebec CHD database (137,493 patients, 35-year follow-up). hART achieves an area under the precision-recall of 28% for HF risk prediction, which is 33% improvement over existing methods. Patients with severe CHD lesion showed a consistently elevated predicted HF risks throughout their lifespan, and patients with genetic syndromes exhibited elevated HF risks until the age of 50. The impact of the birth condition decreases on long-term HF risk. The timing of interventions such as arrhythmia surgery had varying impacts on the lifespan HF risk among the individuals. Arrhythmic surgery performed at a younger age had minimal long-term effects on HF risk, while surgeries during adulthood had a significant lasting impact. Together, we show that hART can detect meaningful lifelong HF risk in CHD patients by capturing both long and short-range dependencies in their past medical events",PubMed

Parallel in-depth analysis of repeat expansions: an updated Clin-CATS workflow for nanopore R10 flow cells,"Hereditary ataxias, caused by expansions of short tandem repeats, are difficult to diagnose using traditional PCR and Southern blot methods, which struggle to detect complex repeat expansions and cannot assess repeat interruptions or methylation. We present an updated Clinical Nanopore Cas9-Targeted Sequencing (Clin-CATS) workflow for analyzing repeat expansions, now compatible with the Oxford Nanopore Technologies R10 flow cell. The workflow incorporates the ONT wf-human-variation Epi2Me workflow, including the Straglr tool to analyze basecalled reads, ensuring compatibility with past, current, and future sequencing chemistries. It expands the number of genes analyzed from 10 to 27 within the ataxia panel and introduces new gene panels for myopathy, neurodegeneration, and ALS/motor neuron disease. Validated with Coriell reference and clinical samples, this method improves the analysis of pathogenic repeat expansions, providing deeper insights into repeat structures while addressing the limitations of traditional approaches",biorxiv
Preliminary Screening for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Using an AI Chatbot as a Genetic Counselor: Clinical Study,"Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) is a major type of hereditary cancer. Establishing effective screening to identify high-risk individuals for HBOC remains a challenge. We developed a prototype of a chatbot system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) for preliminary HBOC screening to determine whether individuals meet the National Comprehensive Cancer Network BRCA1/2 testing criteria. This study's objective was to validate the feasibility of this chatbot in a clinical setting by using it on a patient population that visited a hospital. We validated the medical accuracy of the chatbot system by performing a test on patients who consecutively visited the Kanagawa Cancer Center. The participants completed a preoperation questionnaire to understand their background, including information technology literacy. After the operation, qualitative interviews were conducted to collect data on the usability and acceptability of the system and examine points needing improvement. A total of 11 participants were enrolled between October and December 2020. All of the participants were women, and among them, 10 (91%) had cancer. According to the questionnaire, 6 (54%) participants had never heard of a chatbot, while 7 (64%) had never used one. All participants were able to complete the chatbot operation, and the average time required for the operation was 18.0 (SD 5.44) minutes. The determinations by the chatbot of whether the participants met the BRCA1/2 testing criteria based on their medical and family history were consistent with those by certified genetic counselors (CGCs). We compared the medical histories obtained from the participants by the CGCs with those by the chatbot. Of the 11 participants, 3 (27%) entered information different from that obtained by the CGCs. These discrepancies were caused by the participant's omissions or communication errors with the chatbot. Regarding the family histories, the chatbot provided new information for 3 (27%) of the 11 participants and complemented information for the family members of 5 (45%) participants not interviewed by the CGCs. The chatbot could not obtain some information on the family history of 6 (54%) participants due to several reasons, such as being outside of the scope of the chatbot's interview questions, the participant's omissions, and communication errors with the chatbot. Interview data were classified into the following: (1) features, (2) appearance, (3) usability and preferences, (4) concerns, (5) benefits, and (6) implementation. Favorable comments on implementation feasibility and comments on improvements were also obtained. This study demonstrated that the preliminary screening system for HBOC using an AI chatbot was feasible for real patients",PubMed
Crispant analysis in zebrafish as a tool for rapid functional screening of disease-causing genes for bone fragility,"Heritable Fragile Bone Disorders (FBDs) encompass a spectrum of conditions, from widespread multifactorial to rare monogenic diseases, all characterized by an elevated risk of fractures. The process of validating causative genes and elucidating their pathogenic mechanisms remains a daunting and resource-intensive task. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of a semi-high throughput zebrafish screening platform for rapid validation and in vivo functional testing and validation of candidate disease-causing genes for a wide range of heritable FBDs. Six genes associated with severe recessive forms of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) and four genes associated with bone mineral density (BMD), a key osteoporosis indicator, identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were selected. The crispant screening approach, based on CRISPR/Cas9 technology, was used to phenotype directly in F0 mosaic founder zebrafish. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis revealed a mean indel efficiency of 88% across ten different crispants, indicating a high proportion of knock-out alleles and thus resembling stable knock-out models. We applied multiple techniques to evaluate skeletal characteristics at 7, 14 and 90 days post-fertilization (dpf), including microscopy for osteoblast reporter visualization and mineralization by Alizarin Red S staining, and microCT for quantitative skeletal analysis. While larval crispants exhibited variable differences in osteoblast-positive and mineralized surface areas, adult-stage crispants displayed more pronounced and consistent skeletal phenotypes. Notably, all crispants developed malformed neural and haemal arches, with a majority presenting vertebral fractures and fusions, and some showing significant alterations in vertebral bone volume and density. In addition, aldh7a1 and mbtps2 crispants experienced increased mortality due to severe skeletal deformities. RT-qPCR analysis of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation markers at larval stages indicated differential expression of osteogenic markers bglap and col1a1a in a substantial portion of the crispants, hinting at their utility as biomarkers for FBD crispant screening. In summary, our findings demonstrate that crispant screening in zebrafish offers a viable and efficient strategy for the functional assessment of FBD genes. We advocate for a novel comprehensive approach that integrates various techniques and evaluates distinct skeletal and molecular profiles across different developmental and adult stages. This methodology has the potential to provide new insights into the role of these genes in skeletal biology",biorxiv
High-Throughput Phenotyping of Clinical Text Using Large Language Models,"High-throughput phenotyping automates the mapping of patient signs to standardized ontology concepts and is essential for precision medicine. This study evaluates the automation of phenotyping of clinical summaries from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database using large language models. Due to their rich phenotype data, these summaries can be surrogates for physician notes. We conduct a performance comparison of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo. Our results indicate that GPT-4 surpasses GPT-3.5-Turbo in identifying, categorizing, and normalizing signs, achieving concordance with manual annotators comparable to inter-rater agreement. Despite some limitations in sign normalization, the extensive pre-training of GPT-4 results in high performance and generalizability across several phenotyping tasks while obviating the need for manually annotated training data. Large language models are expected to be the dominant method for automating high-throughput phenotyping of clinical text",arXiv
Folliculin Prevents Lysosomal Degradation of Human Papillomavirus To Support Infectious Cell Entry,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infects epithelial basal cells in the mucosa and either proliferates with the differentiation of the basal cells or persists in them. Multiple host factors are required to support the HPV life cycle; however, the molecular mechanisms involved in cell entry are not yet fully understood. In this study, we performed a genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) knockout (KO) screen in HeLa cells and identified folliculin (FLCN), a GTPase-activating protein for Rag GTPases, as an important host factor for HPV infection. The introduction of single guide RNAs for the FLCN gene into HeLa, HaCaT, and ectocervical Ect1 cells reduced infection by HPV18 pseudovirions (18PsVs) and 16PsVs. FLCN KO HeLa cells also exhibited strong resistance to infection with 18PsVs and 16PsVs; nevertheless, they remained highly susceptible to infections with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped lentivirus and adeno-associated virus. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the numbers of virions binding to the cell surface were slightly increased in FLCN KO cells. However, virion internalization analysis showed that the internalized virions were rapidly degraded in FLCN KO cells. This degradation was blocked by treatment with the lysosome inhibitor bafilomycin A1. Furthermore, the virion degradation phenotype was also observed in Ras-related GTP-binding protein C (RagC) KO cells. These results suggest that FLCN prevents the lysosomal degradation of incoming HPV virions by enhancing lysosomal RagC activity. IMPORTANCE Cell entry by human papillomavirus (HPV) involves a cellular retrograde transport pathway from the endosome to the trans-Golgi network/Golgi apparatus. However, the mechanism by which this viral trafficking is safeguarded is poorly understood. This is the first study showing that the GTPase-activating protein folliculin (FLCN) protects incoming HPV virions from lysosomal degradation and supports infectious cell entry by activating the Rag GTPases, presumably through the suppression of excessive lysosomal biosynthesis. These findings provide new insights into the effects of small GTPase activity regulation on HPV cell entry and enhance our understanding of the HPV degradation pathway",PubMed
Phylogenomics analyses of all species of Swordtails (Genus Xiphophorus) highlights hybridization precedes speciation,"Hybridization has been recognized as an important driving force for evolution, however studies of the genetic consequence and its cause are still lagging behind in vertebrates due to the lack of appropriate experimental systems. Fish of the central American genus Xiphophorus were proposed to have evolved with multiple ancient and ongoing hybridization events, and served as a valuable research model in evolutionary biology and in biomedical research on human disease for more than a century. Here, we provide the complete genome resource and its annotation of all 26 Xiphophorus species. On this dataset we resolved the so far conflicting phylogeny. Through comparative genomic analyses we investigated the molecular evolution of genes related to melanoma, for a main sexually selected trait and for the genetic control of puberty timing, which are predicted to be involved in pre-and postzygotic isolation and thus to influence the probability of interspecific hybridization in Xiphophorus. We demonstrate dramatic size-variation of some gene families across species, despite the reticulate evolution and short divergence time. Finally, we clarify the hybridization history in the genus Xiphophorus genus, settle the long dispute on the hybridization origin of two Southern swordtails, highlight hybridizations precedes speciation, and reveal the distribution of hybridization ancestry remaining in the fused genome",biorxiv
Treatment and outcomes of symptomatic hyperammonemia following asparaginase therapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"Hyperammonemia has been reported following asparaginase administration, consistent with the mechanisms of asparaginase, which catabolizes asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia, and secondarily converts glutamine to glutamate and ammonia. However, there are only a few reports on the treatment of these patients, which varies widely from watchful waiting to treatment with lactulose, protein restriction, sodium benzoate, and phenylbutyrate to dialysis. While many patients with reported asparaginase-induced hyperammonemia (AIH) are asymptomatic, some have severe complications and even fatal outcomes despite medical intervention. Here, we present a cohort of five pediatric patients with symptomatic AIH, which occurred after switching patients from polyethylene glycolated (PEG)- asparaginase to recombinant Crisantaspase Pseudomonas fluorescens (4 patients) or Erwinia (1 patient) asparaginase, and discuss their subsequent management, metabolic workup, and genetic testing. We developed an institutional management plan, which gradually evolved based on our local experience and previous treatment modalities. Because of the significant reduction in glutamine levels after asparaginase administration, sodium benzoate should be used as a first-line ammonia scavenger for symptomatic AIH instead of sodium phenylacetate or phenylbutyrate. This approach facilitated continuation of asparaginase doses, which is known to improve cancer outcomes. We also discuss the potential contribution of genetic modifiers to AIH. Our data highlights the need for increased awareness of symptomatic AIH, especially when an asparaginase with higher glutaminase activity is used, and its prompt management. The utility and efficacy of this management approach should be systematically investigated in a larger cohort of patients",PubMed
Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma (PPGL): A Misdiagnosed Cause of Hypertension during Pregnancy,"Hypertension (HT) during pregnancy is not an infrequent obstetric problem, reaching a prevalence of 5-10%. This condition is highly associated with both maternal and fetal complications if not precisely diagnosed and managed. Even though primary HT, obesity, and preeclampsia are the main causes of HT in this period, other less familiar conditions must be considered during the investigation. Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) are chromaffin cell tumors that produce, store, and secrete catecholamines, leading to HT and other adrenergic manifestations. Recognition of PPGL is crucial since misdiagnosis and improper management can lead to high morbidity and mortality, particularly during pregnancy. We report on two cases of PPGL diagnosed during pregnancy with different managements. Case 1 is a 25-year-old female at 31 weeks of first pregnancy, whose severe HT and life-threatening symptoms prompted an emergency delivery without previous confirmation or medical treatment of a suspected PPGL. After confirmation, a right adrenal PPGL was surgically resected 4 months later, following 15 days of medical therapy. Case 2 is a 22-year-old female at 18 weeks of pregnancy whose symptomatic PPGL was resected in the second trimester. A next-generation sequencing panel, including 23 PPGL-related genes, found no germline pathogenic variants (GPVs) in case 1 and an exon 1-4 germinative heterozygous deletion of the MAX gene in case 2. Despite the different medical approaches, both cases had satisfactory outcomes. Although uncommon, PPGL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of HT in pregnancy since missing the diagnosis and failing to introduce appropriate and timely treatment may lead to dramatic consequences for the mother and fetus. PPGL diagnosed during reproductive age is likely to result from GPV, prompting genetic investigation and counseling",PubMed
End-to-end interpretable disease-gene association prediction,"Identifying disease-gene associations is a fundamental and critical biomedical task towards understanding molecular mechanisms, the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. It is time-consuming and expensive to experimentally verify causal links between diseases and genes. Recently, deep learning methods have achieved tremendous success in identifying candidate genes for genetic diseases. The gene prediction problem can be modeled as a link prediction problem based on the features of nodes and edges of the gene-disease graph. However, most existing researches either build homogeneous networks based on one single data source or heterogeneous networks based on multi-source data, and artificially define meta-paths, so as to learn the network representation of diseases and genes. The former cannot make use of abundant multi-source heterogeneous information, while the latter needs domain knowledge and experience when defining meta-paths, and the accuracy of the model largely depends on the definition of meta-paths. To address the aforementioned challenges above bottlenecks, we propose an end-to-end disease-gene association prediction model with parallel graph transformer network (DGP-PGTN), which deeply integrates the heterogeneous information of diseases, genes, ontologies and phenotypes. DGP-PGTN can automatically and comprehensively capture the multiple latent interactions between diseases and genes, discover the causal relationship between them and is fully interpretable at the same time. We conduct comprehensive experiments and show that DGP-PGTN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly on the task of disease-gene association prediction. Furthermore, DGP-PGTN can automatically learn the implicit relationship between diseases and genes without manually defining meta paths",PubMed
Inferring the Effects of Protein Variants on Protein-Protein Interactions with Interpretable Transformer Representations,"Identifying pathogenetic variants and inferring their impact on protein-protein interactions sheds light on their functional consequences on diseases. Limited by the availability of experimental data on the consequences of protein interaction, most existing methods focus on building models to predict changes in protein binding affinity. Here, we introduced MIPPI, an end-to-end, interpretable transformer-based deep learning model that learns features directly from sequences by leveraging the interaction data from IMEx. MIPPI was specifically trained to determine the types of variant impact (increasing, decreasing, disrupting, and no effect) on protein-protein interactions. We demonstrate the accuracy of MIPPI and provide interpretation through the analysis of learned attention weights, which exhibit correlations with the amino acids interacting with the variant. Moreover, we showed the practicality of MIPPI in prioritizing de novo mutations associated with complex neurodevelopmental disorders and the potential to determine the pathogenic and driving mutations. Finally, we experimentally validated the functional impact of several variants identified in patients with such disorders. Overall, MIPPI emerges as a versatile, robust, and interpretable model, capable of effectively predicting mutation impacts on protein-protein interactions and facilitating the discovery of clinically actionable variants",PubMed
Z-flipon variants reveal the many roles of Z-DNA and Z-RNA in health and disease,"Identifying roles for Z-DNA remains challenging given their dynamic nature. Here, we perform genome-wide interrogation with the DNABERT transformer algorithm trained on experimentally identified Z-DNA forming sequences (Z-flipons). The algorithm yields large performance enhancements (F1 = 0.83) over existing approaches and implements computational mutagenesis to assess the effects of base substitution on Z-DNA formation. We show Z-flipons are enriched in promoters and telomeres, overlapping quantitative trait loci for RNA expression, RNA editing, splicing, and disease-associated variants. We cross-validate across a number of orthogonal databases and define BZ junction motifs. Surprisingly, many effects we delineate are likely mediated through Z-RNA formation. A shared Z-RNA motif is identified in SCARF2, SMAD1, and CACNA1 transcripts, whereas other motifs are present in noncoding RNAs. We provide evidence for a Z-RNA fold that promotes adaptive immunity through alternative splicing of KRAB domain zinc finger proteins. An analysis of OMIM and presumptive gnomAD loss-of-function datasets reveals an overlap of Z-flipons with disease-causing variants in 8.6% and 2.9% of Mendelian disease genes, respectively, greatly extending the range of phenotypes mapped to Z-flipons",PubMed
Therapeutic gene target prediction using novel deep hypergraph representation learning,"Identifying therapeutic genes is crucial for developing treatments targeting genetic causes of diseases, but experimental trials are costly and time-consuming. Although many deep learning approaches aim to identify biomarker genes, predicting therapeutic target genes remains challenging due to the limited number of known targets. To address this, we propose HIT (Hypergraph Interaction Transformer), a deep hypergraph representation learning model that identifies a gene's therapeutic potential, biomarker status, or lack of association with diseases. HIT uses hypergraph structures of genes, ontologies, diseases, and phenotypes, employing attention-based learning to capture complex relationships. Experiments demonstrate HIT's state-of-the-art performance, explainability, and ability to identify novel therapeutic targets",PubMed
Large language models identify causal genes in complex trait GWAS,"Identifying underlying causal genes at significant loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) remains a challenging task. Literature evidence for disease-gene co-occurrence, whether through automated approaches or human expert annotation, is one way of nominating causal genes at GWAS loci. However, current automated approaches are limited in accuracy and generalizability, and expert annotation is not scalable to hundreds of thousands of significant findings. Here, we demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can accurately identify genes likely to be causal at loci from GWAS. By evaluating the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on datasets of GWAS loci with high-confidence causal gene annotations, we show that these models outperform state-of-the-art methods in identifying putative causal genes. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to augment existing approaches to causal gene discovery",medrxiv
"Clinical features and potential markers of disease in idiopathic non-histaminergic angioedema, a real-life study","Idiopathic non-histaminergic acquired angioedema (InH-AAE) is a rare disease, with unknown etiology and pathogenesis, characterized by recurrent clinical manifestations and resistance to antihistamines and corticosteroids. We aim to evaluate clinical features and potential markers of disease in an Italian cohort of patients with InH-AAE. We enrolled 26 patients diagnosed with InH-AAE. Information about clinical features, treatments, routine laboratory investigations, immunological and genetic tests were collected. We assessed plasma levels of complement components, angiogenic and lymphangiogenic mediators, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and activity of phospholipases A2. Finally, patients underwent nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC); both quantitative and qualitative capillaroscopic parameters were analyzed. Plasma levels of VEGFs were similar in healthy controls and in InH-AAE patients. ANGPT1 was decreased in InH-AAE patients compared to controls while ANGPT2 was similar to controls. Interestingly, the ANGPT2/ANGPT1 ratio (an index of vascular permeability) was increased in InH-AAE patients compared to controls. sPLA2 activity, elevated in patients with C1-INH-HAE, showed differences also when measured in InH-AAE patients. TNF-α concentration was higher in InH-AAE patients than in healthy controls, conversely, the levels of CXCL8, and IL-6 were similar in both groups. At the NVC, the capillary loops mainly appeared short and tortuous in InH-AAE patients. InH-AAE represents a diagnostic challenge. Due to the potential life-threatening character of this condition, a prompt identification of the potentially bradykinin-mediated forms is crucial. A better comprehension of the mechanism involved in InH-AAE would also lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches to improve life quality of patients affected by this disabling disease",PubMed
A multi-task deep learning model based on comprehensive feature integration and self-attention mechanism for predicting response to anti-PD1/PD-L1,"Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) has been widely used in the treatment of advanced cancers, but predicting their efficacy remains challenging. Traditional biomarkers are numerous but exhibit heterogeneity within populations. For comprehensively utilizing the ICI-related biomarkers, we aim to conduct multidimensional feature selection and deep learning model construction. We used statistical and machine learning methods to map features of different levels to next-generation sequencing gene expression. We integrated genes from different sources into the feature input of a deep learning model, by means of self-attention mechanism. We performed feature selection at the single-cell sequencing level, PD-L1 (CD274) analysis level, tumor mutational burden (TMB)/mismatch repair (MMR) level, and somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) level, obtaining 96 feature genes. Based on the pan-cancer dataset, we trained a multi-task deep learning model. We tested the model in the bladder urothelial carcinoma testing set 1 (AUC = 0.62, n = 298), bladder urothelial carcinoma testing set 2 (AUC = 0.66, n = 89), non-small cell lung cancer testing set (AUC = 0.85, n = 27), and skin cutaneous melanoma testing set (AUC = 0.71, n = 27). Our study demonstrates the potential of the deep learning model for integrating multidimensional features in predicting the outcome of ICI. Our study also provides a potential methodological case for medical scenarios requiring the integration of multiple levels of features",PubMed
Chemogenetic stimulation of phrenic motor output and diaphragm activity,"Impaired respiratory motor output contributes to morbidity and mortality in many neurodegenerative diseases and neurologic injuries. We investigated if expressing designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) in the mid-cervical spinal cord could effectively stimulate phrenic motor output to increase diaphragm activation. Two primary questions were addressed: 1) does effective DREADD-mediated diaphragm activation require focal expression in phrenic motoneurons (vs. non-specific mid-cervical expression), and 2) can this method produce a sustained increase in inspiratory tidal volume? Wild type (C57/bl6) and ChAT-Cre mice received bilateral intraspinal (C4) injections of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding the hM3D(Gq) excitatory DREADD. In wild-type mice, this produced non-specific DREADD expression throughout the mid-cervical ventral horn. In ChAT-Cre mice, a Cre-dependent viral construct was used to drive neuronal DREADD expression in the C4 ventral horn, targeting phrenic motoneurons. Diaphragm EMG was recorded in isoflurane-anesthetized spontaneously breathing mice at 4-9 weeks post-AAV delivery. The DREADD ligand JHU37160 (J60) caused a bilateral, sustained (>1 hour) increase in inspiratory EMG bursting in both groups; the relative increase was greater in ChAT-Cre mice. Additional experiments in ChAT-Cre rats were conducted to determine if spinal DREADD activation could increase inspiratory tidal volume (VT) during spontaneous breathing, assessed using whole-body plethysmography without anesthesia. Three-to-four months after intraspinal (C4) injection of AAV driving Cre-dependent hM3D(Gq) expression, intravenous J60 resulted in a sustained (>30 min) increase in VT. Subsequently, phrenic nerve recordings performed under urethane anesthesia confirmed that J60 evoked a > 200% increase in inspiratory output. We conclude that targeting mid-cervical spinal DREADD expression to the phrenic motoneuron pool enables ligand-induced, sustained increases in phrenic motor output and VT. Further development of this technology may enable application to clinical conditions associated with impaired diaphragm activation and hypoventilation",biorxiv
Using a Natural Language Processing Approach to Support Rapid Knowledge Acquisition,"Implementing artificial intelligence to extract insights from large, real-world clinical data sets can supplement and enhance knowledge management efforts for health sciences research and clinical care.

Through this process, the Word Cloud extracts the most prominent concepts found in the clinical documentation of a specific patient or population.

Evaluating the association of APOE genotype and cognitive resilience in SuperAgers,"Importance""SuperAgers"" are oldest-old adults (ages 80+) whose memory performance resembles that of adults in their 50s to mid-60s. Factors underlying their exemplary memory are underexplored in large, racially diverse cohorts.  ObjectiveTo determine the frequency of APOE genotypes in non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White SuperAgers compared to middle-aged (ages 50-64), old (ages 65-79), and oldest-old (ages 80+) controls and Alzheimers disease (AD) dementia cases.  DesignThis multicohort study selected data from eight longitudinal cohort studies of normal aging and AD.  SettingVariable recruitment criteria and follow-up intervals, including both population-based and clinical-based samples.  ParticipantsInclusion in our analyses required APOE genotype, that participants be age 50+, and are identified as either non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic White. In total, 18,080 participants were included in the present study with a total of 78,549 datapoints.  Main Outcomes and MeasuresHarmonized, longitudinal memory, executive function, and language scores were obtained from the Alzheimers Disease Sequencing Project Phenotype Harmonization Consortium (ADSP-PHC). SuperAgers, controls, and AD dementia cases were identified by cognitive scores using a residual approach and clinical diagnoses across multiple timepoints when available. SuperAgers were compared to AD dementia cases and cognitively normal controls using age-defined bins (middle-aged, old, oldest-old).  ResultsAcross racialized groups, SuperAgers had significantly higher proportions of APOE-{varepsilon}2 alleles and lower proportions of APOE-{varepsilon}4 alleles compared to cases. Similar differences were observed between SuperAgers and middle-aged and old controls. Non-Hispanic White SuperAgers had significantly lower proportions of APOE-{varepsilon}4 alleles and significantly higher proportions of APOE-{varepsilon}2 alleles compared to all cases and controls, including oldest-old controls. In contrast, non-Hispanic Black SuperAgers had significantly lower proportions of APOE-{varepsilon}4 alleles compared to cases and younger controls, and significantly higher proportions of APOE- {varepsilon}2 alleles compared only to cases.  Conclusions and RelevanceIn the largest study to date, we demonstrated strong evidence that the frequency of APOE-{varepsilon}4 and -{varepsilon}2 alleles differ between non-Hispanic White SuperAgers and AD dementia cases and cognitively normal controls. Differences in the role of APOE in SuperAging by race underlines distinctions in mechanisms conferring resilience across race groups given likely differences in genetic ancestry.  Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes the frequency of APOE-{varepsilon}4 and APOE-{varepsilon}2 alleles explain the exceptional memory of non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White SuperAgers?  FindingsIn this multicohort, multiracial study, SuperAgers had significantly higher proportions of APOE-{varepsilon}2 alleles and lower proportions of APOE-{varepsilon}4 alleles compared to Alzheimers disease dementia cases. Non-Hispanic White SuperAgers had significantly lower proportions of APOE- {varepsilon}4 alleles and significantly higher proportions of APOE-{varepsilon}2 alleles compared to all cases and controls, including oldest-old (ages 80+) controls. In contrast, non-Hispanic Black SuperAgers had significantly lower proportions of APOE-{varepsilon}4 alleles compared to cases and younger controls, and only significantly higher proportions of APOE-{varepsilon}2 alleles compared to cases.  MeaningThis is the largest study to date to identify differences in APOE-{varepsilon}4 allele frequency based on SuperAger status, and the first study of SuperAgers to find a relationship between APOE-{varepsilon}2 allele frequency and SuperAger status. As has been found in studies of middle-aged (ages 50-64) and old (ages 65-79) adults, genetic resiliency in oldest-old (80+) age likely differs by genetic ancestry",medrxiv
Multidimensional Epigenetic Clocks Demonstrate Accelerated Aging Across Physiological Systems in Schizophrenia: A Meta-Analysis,"Importance: Schizophrenia is associated with increased age-related morbidity, mortality, and frailty, which are not entirely explained by behavioral factors. Prior studies using epigenetic clocks have suggested that schizophrenia is associated with accelerated aging, however these studies have primarily used unidimensional clocks that summarize aging as a single ""biological age"" score.  Objective: This meta-analysis uses multidimensional epigenetic clocks that split aging into multiple scores to analyze biological aging in schizophrenia. These novel clocks may provide more granular insights into the mechanistic relationships between schizophrenia, epigenetic aging, and premature morbidity and mortality.  Study selection: Selected studies included patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and non- psychiatric controls with available DNA methylation data. Seven cross-sectional datasets were available for this study, with a total sample size of 1,891 patients with schizophrenia and 1,881 controls.  Data extraction and synthesis: Studies were selected by consensus Meta-analyses were performed using fixed-effect models.  Main outcomes and measures: We analyzed multidimensional epigenetic clocks, including causality- enriched CausAge clocks, physiological system-specific SystemsAge clocks, RetroelementAge, DNAmEMRAge, and multi omics-informed OMICmAge. Meta-analyses examined clock associations with schizophrenia disease status and clozapine use, after accounting for age and sex.  Results: Overall SystemsAge, CausAge, DNAmEMRAge, and OMICmAge scores demonstrated increased epigenetic aging in patients with schizophrenia after strict multiple-comparison testing. Ten of the eleven SystemsAge sub-clocks corresponding to different physiological systems demonstrated increased aging, with strongest effects for Heart and Lung followed by Metabolic and Brain systems. The causality- enriched clocks indicated increases in both damaging and adaptive aging, though these effects were weaker compared to SystemsAge scores. OMICmAge indicated changes in multiple clinical biomarkers, including hematologic and hepatic markers that support system-specific aging, as well as novel proteins and metabolites not previously linked to schizophrenia. Most clocks demonstrated age acceleration at the first psychotic episode. Notably, clozapine use was associated with increased Heart and Inflammation aging, which may partially be driven by smoking. Most results survived strict Bonferroni multiple testing correction.  Conclusions and relevance: These are the first analyses of novel multidimensional clocks in patients with schizophrenia and provide a nuanced view of aging that identifies multiple organ systems at high risk for disease in schizophrenia-related disorders",medrxiv
Can Electronic care planning using AI Summarization Yield equal Documentation Quality? (EASY eDocQ),"ImportanceData, information and knowledge in health care has expanded exponentially over the last 50 years, leading to significant challenges with information overload and complex, fragmented care plans. Generative AI has the potential to facilitate summarization and integration of knowledge and wisdom to through rapid integration of data and information to enable efficient care planning.  ObjectiveOur objective was to understand the value of AI generated summarization through short synopses at the care transition from hospital to first outpatient visit.  DesignUsing a de-identified data set of recently hospitalized patients with multiple chronic illnesses, we used the data-information-knowledge-wisdom framework to train clinicians and an open-source generative AI Large Language Model system to produce summarized patient assessments after hospitalizations. Both sets of synopses were judged blinded in random order by clinician judges.  ParticipantsDe-identified patients had multiple chronic conditions and a recent hospitalization. Raters were physicians at various levels of training.  Main outcomeAccuracy, succinctness, synthesis and usefulness of synopses using a standardized scale with scores > 80% indicating success.  ResultsAI and clinicians summarized 80 patients with 10% overlap. In blinded trials, AI synopses were rated as useful 75% of the time versus 76% for human generated ones. AI had lower succinctness ratings for the Data synopsis task (55-67%) versus human (84-86%). For accuracy and synthesis, AI had near equal or better scores in other domains (AI: 72%-79%, humans: 68%-84%), with best scores from AI in Wisdom. Interrater agreement was moderate, indicating different preferences for synopsis content, and did not vary between AI and human-created synopses.  DiscussionAI-created synopses that were nearly equivalent to human-created ones; they were slightly longer and did not always synthesize individual data elements compared to humans. Given their rapid introduction into clinical care, our framework and protocol for evaluation of these tools provides strong benchmarking capabilities for developers and implementers.  Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan a Generative AI Large Language Model be trained to generate accurate and useful patient synopses through chart summarization for use in outpatient settings after hospital discharge?  FindingsUsing a Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom framework, clinicians and an open-source AI system were trained to summarize charts; these synopses were rated blindly using a standardized index. Synopses from the AI were rated as useful 75% of the time versus 76% for human generated ones, AI synopses scored highest in Wisdom for accuracy and synthesis. Interrater agreement was moderate but did not vary between AI and human.  MeaningThis study provides a concrete, replicable protocol for benchmarking LLM summarization outputs and demonstrates general equivalence to human-created synopses for outpatient use after care transitions",medrxiv
Polygenic Susceptibility to Diabetes and Poor Glycemic Control in Stroke Survivors,"ImportanceType 2 diabetes mellitus is a highly heritable disease with numerous identified genetic risk variants. However, the concrete role of these variants in the clinical care of stroke patients remains poorly understood.  ObjectiveTo evaluate whether higher polygenic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus (PSD) is associated with worse glycemic control and higher risk of cardiovascular events in stroke survivors.  Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe conducted a 3-stage genetic association study. First, we used a cross-sectional design and data from the UK Biobank to evaluate the relationship between PSD and glycemic control (enrollment took place between 2006 and 2010). Second, we used a cross-sectional design and data from the All of Us Research Program to replicate associations identified in the prior stage (enrollment between 2018 and 2022). Third, we used a prospective design and data from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) clinical trial to evaluate the relationship between PSD and post-stroke acute cardiovascular events (enrollment between 1997 and 2001). The present analyses were performed between May 2022 and August 2023.  ExposuresLow, intermediate, and high PSD modeled through categories of a polygenic risk score that included up to 462 independent DNA sequence variants associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus at genome-wide levels (p<5}10-8).  Main Outcomes and MeasuresHemoglobin A1c levels, treatment-resistant diabetes mellitus (defined as hemoglobin A1c [&ge;] 7.0% despite antidiabetic treatment), and risk of post-stroke acute cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death).  ResultsStage 1 included 5,670 stroke survivors (mean age 61, 41% females), including 1,215 (21%) with known diabetes. Compared to stroke survivors with low PSD, those with high PSD had 35% higher hemoglobin A1c (beta 0.35, standard error [SE] 0.034; p <0.001) and 3 times the risk of having treatment-resistant diabetes (OR 3.40, 95%CI 2.52-6.24; p <0.001). These results pertaining to hemoglobin A1c remained significant when evaluating diabetics and non-diabetics separately (both tests p<0.05). Stage 2 replicated these results in 2,012 stroke survivors, including 447 (22.2%) with diabetes (mean age 64, 52% females, p <0.05 for all tests). Stage 3 included 1,750 stroke survivors (mean age 68, 34.8% females), including 441 (25.2%) with diabetes. Compared to stroke survivors with low PSD, those with high PSD had 50% higher risk of post-stroke cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 1.53, 95%CI 1.03, 2.28, p < 0.05).  Conclusions and RelevanceAmong stroke survivors enrolled in 3 different studies, a higher PSD was associated with poorer glycemic control and higher risk of treatment-resistant diabetes and post-stroke vascular events. Given that millions of Americans are receiving diabetes-related polygenic risk data from direct-to-consumer companies, further research is needed to determine whether precision medicine strategies based on this information can improve the clinical management of these patients.  KEY POINTS  QuestionDoes polygenic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus lead to worse glycemic control and higher risk of cardiovascular events in stroke survivors?  FindingsHigher polygenic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus, modeled via polygenic risk scoring, was associated with higher levels of Hemoglobin A1c, higher risk of treatment resistant diabetes mellitus, and higher risk of recurrent cardiovascular events in stroke survivors.  MeaningPolygenic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes is associated with worse clinical trajectories in stroke survivors. Given that millions of Americans are receiving diabetes-related polygenic risk data from direct-to-consumer companies, further research is needed to understand how this information could help post-stroke clinical management",medrxiv
Genetic and Demographic Determinants of Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy Risk and Severity,"ImportanceUnderstanding the pathogenic mechanisms of Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is essential for developing gene-targeted therapies.  ObjectiveTo investigate associations between demographic data and age at first keratoplasty in a large genetically refined FECD cohort.  Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis retrospective cohort study recruited 894 individuals with FECD at Moorfields Eye Hospital (London) and General University Hospital (Prague). Ancestry was inferred from genome-wide SNP array data. CTG18.1 status was determined by short tandem repeat and/or triplet-primed PCR. One or more expanded alleles ([&ge;]50 repeats) were classified as expansion-positive (Exp+). Expansion-negative (Exp-) cases were whole exome sequenced.  Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Association between variants in FECD-associated genes, demographic data and age at first keratoplasty.  ResultsWithin the total cohort (n=894), 77.3% were Exp+. The majority of European (668/829, 80.6%) and South Asian (14/22, 63.6%) patients were Exp+, whereas the majority of those with African (30/37, 81.1%), East Asian (2/3,66.7%), and American Admixture (2/3, 66.7%) ancestry were Exp-. The percentage of females was significantly higher (151, 74.4%) in the Exp-cohort compared to the Exp+ (395, 57.2%; P<.001). The median (IQR) age at first keratoplasty of the Exp+ patients (68.2 [63.2-73.6] years) was older than the Exp-patients (61.3 [52.6-70.4] years; P<.001). The CTG18.1 repeat length of the largest expanded allele within the Exp+ group was inversely correlated with the age at first keratoplasty (r = -0.087 [95% CI: -0.162 to -0.012], P=.02). The ratio of biallelic to monoallelic expanded alleles was higher in the FECD cohort compared to an unaffected control group (P<.001), indicating that two Exp+ alleles increase disease penetrance compared to one expansion. We only identified potentially pathogenic variants (MAF <0.01; CADD >15) in FECD-associated genes in 13 (10.1%) Exp-individuals.  Conclusions and RelevanceCTG18.1 expansions are present in most European and South Asian patients with FECD. Repeat length and zygosity status of CTG18.1 modify disease severity and penetrance. Known disease-associated genes account for only a minority of Exp-cases, with unknown risk factors determining disease in the rest of this subgroup. These data have important implications for the development of future FECD gene-targeted therapies.  Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow do demographics and genetic risk factors determine FECD disease risk and severity?  FindingsThis multi-center FECD cohort (n=894) study reveals TCF4 repeat expansions (CTG18.1) underlie disease in 77.3% of total cases, with longer repeats and biallelic expansion correlating with earlier keratoplasty and increased penetrance, respectively.  Female overrepresentation is driven by cases without CTG18.1 expansions, where missing heritability remains high.  MeaningDemographic factors and molecular diagnosis, including CTG18.1 repeat length and expanded allele dosage, are clinically relevant metrics that should inform future therapeutic strategies and clinical trial design",medrxiv
A landmark federal interagency collaboration to promote data science in health care: Million Veteran Program-Computational Health Analytics for Medical Precision to Improve Outcomes Now,"In 2016, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) established an Interagency Agreement (IAA), the Million Veteran Program-Computational Health Analytics for Medical Precision to Improve Outcomes Now (MVP-CHAMPION) research collaboration. Oversight fell under the VA Office of Research Development (VA ORD) and DOE headquarters. An Executive Committee and 2 senior scientific liaisons work with VA and DOE leadership to optimize efforts in the service of shared scientific goals. The program supported centralized data management and genomic analysis including creation of a scalable approach to cataloging phenotypes. Cross-cutting methods including natural language processing, image processing, and reusable code were developed. The 79.6 million dollar collaboration has supported centralized data management and genomic analysis including a scalable approach to cataloging phenotypes and launched over 10 collaborative scientific projects in health conditions highly prevalent in veterans. A ground-breaking analysis on the Summit and Andes supercomputers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) of the genetic underpinnings of over 2000 health conditions across 44 million genetic variants which resulted in the identification of 38 270 independent genetic variants associating with one or more health traits. Of these, over 2000 identified associations were unique to non-European ancestry. Cross-cutting methods have advanced state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) including large language natural language processing and a system biology study focused on opioid addiction awarded the 2018 Gordon Bell Prize for outstanding achievement in high-performance computing. The collaboration has completed work in prostate cancer, suicide prevention, and cardiovascular disease, and cross-cutting data science. Predictive models developed in these projects are being tested for application in clinical management. Eight new projects were launched in 2023, taking advantage of the momentum generated by the previous collaboration. A major challenge has been limitations in the scope of appropriated funds at DOE which cannot currently be used for health research. Extensive multidisciplinary interactions take time to establish and are essential to continued progress. New funding models for maintaining high-performance computing infrastructure at the ORNL and for supporting continued collaboration by joint VA-DOE research teams are needed",PubMed
A transformer-based unified multimodal framework for Alzheimer's disease assessment,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD) assessment, traditional deep learning approaches have often employed separate methodologies to handle the diverse modalities of input data. Recognizing the critical need for a cohesive and interconnected analytical framework, we propose the AD-Transformer, a novel transformer-based unified deep learning model. This innovative framework seamlessly integrates structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), clinical, and genetic data from the extensive Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, encompassing 1651 subjects. By employing a Patch-CNN block, the AD-Transformer efficiently transforms image data into image tokens, while a linear projection layer adeptly converts non-image data into corresponding tokens. As the core, a transformer block learns comprehensive representations of the input data, capturing the intricate interplay between modalities. The AD-Transformer sets a new benchmark in AD diagnosis and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) conversion prediction, achieving remarkable average area under curve (AUC) values of 0.993 and 0.845, respectively, surpassing those of traditional image-only models and non-unified multimodal models. Our experimental results confirmed the potential of the AD-Transformer as a potent tool in AD diagnosis and MCI conversion prediction. By providing a unified framework that jointly learns holistic representations of both image and non-image data, the AD-Transformer paves the way for more effective and precise clinical assessments, offering a clinically adaptable strategy for leveraging diverse data modalities in the battle against AD",PubMed
A cryptic microdeletion del(12)(p11.21p11.23) within an unbalanced translocation t(7;12)(q21.13;q23.1) implicates new candidate loci for intellectual disability and Kallmann syndrome,"In a patient diagnosed with both Kallmann syndrome (KS) and intellectual disability (ID), who carried an apparently balanced translocation t(7;12)(q22;q24)dn, array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) disclosed a cryptic heterozygous 4.7 Mb deletion del(12)(p11.21p11.23), unrelated to the translocation breakpoint. This novel discovery prompted us to consider the possibility that the combination of KS and neurological disorder in this patient could be attributed to gene(s) within this specific deletion at 12p11.21-12p11.23, rather than disrupted or dysregulated genes at the translocation breakpoints. To further support this hypothesis, we expanded our study by screening five candidate genes at both breakpoints of the chromosomal translocation in a cohort of 48 KS patients. However, no mutations were found, thus reinforcing our supposition. In order to delve deeper into the characterization of the 12p11.21-12p11.23 region, we enlisted six additional patients with small copy number variations (CNVs) and analyzed eight individuals carrying small CNVs in this region from the DECIPHER database. Our investigation utilized a combination of complementary approaches. Firstly, we conducted a comprehensive phenotypic-genotypic comparison of reported CNV cases. Additionally, we reviewed knockout animal models that exhibit phenotypic similarities to human conditions. Moreover, we analyzed reported variants in candidate genes and explored their association with corresponding phenotypes. Lastly, we examined the interacting genes associated with these phenotypes to gain further insights. As a result, we identified a dozen candidate genes: TSPAN11 as a potential KS candidate gene, TM7SF3, STK38L, ARNTL2, ERGIC2, TMTC1, DENND5B, and ETFBKMT as candidate genes for the neurodevelopmental disorder, and INTS13, REP15, PPFIBP1, and FAR2 as candidate genes for KS with ID. Notably, the high-level expression pattern of these genes in relevant human tissues further supported their candidacy. Based on our findings, we propose that dosage alterations of these candidate genes may contribute to sexual and/or cognitive impairments observed in patients with KS and/or ID. However, the confirmation of their causal roles necessitates further identification of point mutations in these candidate genes through next-generation sequencing",PubMed
SNP profile for quantitative trait nucleotide in populations with small effective size and its impact on mapping and genomic predictions,"In animal populations, increasing the SNP density by incorporating sequence information only marginally increases prediction accuracies. To find out why, we used statistical models and simulations to investigate the profile or distribution of SNP around Quantitative Trait Nucleotides (QTN) in populations with small effective population size (Ne). A QTN profile created by averaging SNP solutions around each QTN was similar to the shape of expected pairwise linkage disequilibrium (PLD) based on Ne and genetic distance between SNP, with a distinct peak for the QTN. Populations with smaller Ne showed lower but wider QTN profiles; however, adding more genotyped individuals with phenotypes dragged the profile closer to the QTN; the QTN profile was higher and narrower for populations with larger compared to smaller Ne. Assuming the PLD curve for the QTN profile, 80% of the additive genetic variance explained by each QTN is contained in 8 ""Stam"" segments (one segment = 1/4Ne Morgans), corresponding to 1.6 Mb in cattle, and 5 Mb in pigs and broiler chickens. With such large segments, identifying QTN is difficult even if all of them are in the data and the assumed genetic architecture is simplistic. Additional complexity in QTN detection arises from confounding of QTN profiles with signals due to relationships, overlapping profiles with closely-spaced QTN, and spurious signals due to imputation errors. However, small Ne allows for accurate prediction with large data even without QTN identification because QTN are accounted for by QTN profiles if SNP density is sufficient to saturate the segments",biorxiv
Ensemble transformer-based multiple instance learning to predict pathological subtypes and tumor mutational burden from histopathological whole slide images of endometrial and colorectal cancer,"In endometrial cancer (EC) and colorectal cancer (CRC), in addition to microsatellite instability, tumor mutational burden (TMB) has gradually gained attention as a genomic biomarker that can be used clinically to determine which patients may benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors. High TMB is characterized by a large number of mutated genes, which encode aberrant tumor neoantigens, and implies a better response to immunotherapy. Hence, a part of EC and CRC patients associated with high TMB may have higher chances to receive immunotherapy. TMB measurement was mainly evaluated by whole-exome sequencing or next-generation sequencing, which was costly and difficult to be widely applied in all clinical cases. Therefore, an effective, efficient, low-cost and easily accessible tool is urgently needed to distinguish the TMB status of EC and CRC patients. In this study, we present a deep learning framework, namely Ensemble Transformer-based Multiple Instance Learning with Self-Supervised Learning Vision Transformer feature encoder (ETMIL-SSLViT), to predict pathological subtype and TMB status directly from the H&E stained whole slide images (WSIs) in EC and CRC patients, which is helpful for both pathological classification and cancer treatment planning. Our framework was evaluated on two different cancer cohorts, including an EC cohort with 918 histopathology WSIs from 529 patients and a CRC cohort with 1495 WSIs from 594 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The experimental results show that the proposed methods achieved excellent performance and outperforming seven state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in cancer subtype classification and TMB prediction on both cancer datasets. Fisher's exact test further validated that the associations between the predictions of the proposed models and the actual cancer subtype or TMB status are both extremely strong (p<0.001). These promising findings show the potential of our proposed methods to guide personalized treatment decisions by accurately predicting the EC and CRC subtype and the TMB status for effective immunotherapy planning for EC and CRC patients",PubMed
Predicting Openness of Communication in Families With Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome: Natural Language Processing Analysis,"In health care research, patient-reported opinions are a critical element of personalized medicine and contribute to optimal health care delivery. The importance of integrating natural language processing (NLP) methods to extract patient-reported opinions has been gradually acknowledged over the past years. One form of NLP is sentiment analysis, which extracts and analyses information by detecting feelings (thoughts, emotions, attitudes, etc) behind words. Sentiment analysis has become particularly popular following the rise of digital interactions. However, NLP and sentiment analysis in the context of intrafamilial communication for genetic cancer risk is still unexplored. Due to privacy laws, intrafamilial communication is the main avenue to inform at-risk relatives about the pathogenic variant and the possibility of increased cancer risk. The study examined the role of sentiment in predicting openness of intrafamilial communication about genetic cancer risk associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome. We used narratives derived from 53 in-depth interviews with individuals from families that harbor pathogenic variants associated with HBOC: first, to quantify openness of communication about cancer risk, and second, to examine the role of sentiment in predicting openness of communication. The interviews were conducted between 2019 and 2021 in Switzerland and South Korea using the same interview guide. We used NLP to extract and quantify textual features to construct a handcrafted lexicon about interpersonal communication of genetic testing results and cancer risk associated with HBOC. Moreover, we examined the role of sentiment in predicting openness of communication using a stepwise linear regression model. To test model accuracy, we used a split-validation set. We measured the performance of the training and testing model using area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and root mean square error. Higher ""openness of communication"" scores were associated with higher overall net sentiment score of the narrative, higher fear, being single, having nonacademic education, and higher informational support within the family. Our results demonstrate that NLP was highly effective in analyzing unstructured texts from individuals of different cultural and linguistic backgrounds and could also reliably predict a measure of ""openness of communication"" (area under the curve=0.72) in the context of genetic cancer risk associated with HBOC. Our study showed that NLP can facilitate assessment of openness of communication in individuals carrying a pathogenic variant associated with HBOC. Findings provided promising evidence that various features from narratives such as sentiment and fear are important predictors of interpersonal communication and self-disclosure in this context. Our approach is promising and can be expanded in the field of personalized medicine and technology-mediated communication",PubMed
Knowledge graph-based thought: a knowledge graph-enhanced LLM framework for pan-cancer question answering,"In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in various domains, notably in biomedical sciences. However, their real-world application is often limited by issues like erroneous outputs and hallucinatory responses. We developed the knowledge graph-based thought (KGT) framework, an innovative solution that integrates LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve their initial responses by utilizing verifiable information from KGs, thus significantly reducing factual errors in reasoning. The KGT framework demonstrates strong adaptability and performs well across various open-source LLMs. Notably, KGT can facilitate the discovery of new uses for existing drugs through potential drug-cancer associations and can assist in predicting resistance by analyzing relevant biomarkers and genetic mechanisms. To evaluate the knowledge graph question answering task within biomedicine, we utilize a pan-cancer knowledge graph to develop a pan-cancer question answering benchmark, named pan-cancer question answering. The KGT framework substantially improves the accuracy and utility of LLMs in the biomedical field. This study serves as a proof of concept, demonstrating its exceptional performance in biomedical question answering",PubMed
A novel transformer-based aggregation model for predicting gene mutations in lung adenocarcinoma,"In recent years, predicting gene mutations on whole slide imaging (WSI) has gained prominence. The primary challenge is extracting global information and achieving unbiased semantic aggregation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Transformer-based aggregation model, employing a self-learning weight aggregation mechanism to mitigate semantic bias caused by the abundance of features in WSI. Additionally, we adopt a random patch training method, which enhances model learning richness by randomly extracting feature vectors from WSI, thus addressing the issue of limited data. To demonstrate the model's effectiveness in predicting gene mutations, we leverage the lung adenocarcinoma dataset from Shandong Provincial Hospital for prior knowledge learning. Subsequently, we assess TP53, CSMD3, LRP1B, and TTN gene mutations using lung adenocarcinoma tissue pathology images and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The results indicate a notable increase in the AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) value, averaging 4%, attesting to the model's performance improvement. Our research offers an efficient model to explore the correlation between pathological image features and molecular characteristics in lung adenocarcinoma patients. This model introduces a novel approach to clinical genetic testing, expected to enhance the efficiency of identifying molecular features and genetic testing in lung adenocarcinoma patients, ultimately providing more accurate and reliable results for related studies",PubMed
Improving performance in colorectal cancer histology decomposition using deep and ensemble machine learning,"In routine colorectal cancer management, histologic samples stained with hematoxylin and eosin are commonly used. Nonetheless, their potential for defining objective biomarkers for patient stratification and treatment selection is still being explored. The current gold standard relies on expensive and time-consuming genetic tests. However, recent research highlights the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to facilitate the extraction of clinically relevant biomarkers from these readily available images. These CNN-based biomarkers can predict patient outcomes comparably to golden standards, with the added advantages of speed, automation, and minimal cost. The predictive potential of CNN-based biomarkers fundamentally relies on the ability of CNNs to accurately classify diverse tissue types from whole slide microscope images. Consequently, enhancing the accuracy of tissue class decomposition is critical to amplifying the prognostic potential of imaging-based biomarkers. This study introduces a hybrid deep transfer learning and ensemble machine learning model that improves upon previous approaches, including a transformer and neural architecture search baseline for this task. We employed a pairing of the EfficientNetV2 architecture with a random forest classification head. Our model achieved 96.74% accuracy (95% CI: 96.3%-97.1%) on the external test set and 99.89% on the internal test set. Recognizing the potential of these models in the task, we have made them publicly available",PubMed
"Genetic, natal, and spatial drivers of social phenotypes in wild great tits","In social animals, group dynamics profoundly influence collective behaviours, vital in processes like information sharing and predator vigilance. Disentangling the causes of individual-level variation in social behaviours is crucial for understanding the evolution of sociality. This requires unravelling the genetic and environmental basis of these behaviours, which is challenging in uncontrolled wild populations. In this study, we partitioned genetic, developmental and spatial environmental variation in repeatable social network traits derived from foraging events using a multigenerational pedigree and extensive observational social data from a long-term monitored great tit population. Animal models indicated minimal narrow-sense heritability (2-3%) in group size choice, further reduced when spatial location was considered, which itself explains a substantial 30% of the observed variation. Individual gregariousness also had a small genetic component, with a low heritability estimate for degree (<5%). Centrality showed heritability up to 10% in one of three years sampled, whereas betweenness showed none, indicating modest genetic variation in individual sociability, but not group-switching tendencies. These findings suggest a small, albeit detectable, genetic influence on individual sociality, but pronounced spatial effects. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of common environment effects (natal origin and brood identity), which essentially negated genetic effects when explicitly accounted for. In addition, we demonstrate that phenotypic resemblance can be a result of similarities beyond shared genes; spatial proximity at birth and natal environmental similarity explained up to 8% of individual sociability. Our results thus emphasise the role of non-genetic factors, particularly developmental and spatial variation, in shaping individual social behavioural tendencies",biorxiv
A Suite of Foundation Models Captures the Contextual Interplay Between Codons,"In the canonical genetic code, many amino acids are assigned more than one codon. Work by us and others has shown that the choice of these synonymous codon is not random, and carries regulatory and functional consequences. Existing protein foundation models ignore this context-dependent role of coding sequence in shaping the protein landscape of the cell. To address this gap, we introduce cdsFM, a suite of codon-resolution large language models, including both EnCodon and DeCodon models, with up to 1B parameters. Pre-trained on 60 million protein-coding sequences from more than 5,000 species, our models effectively learn the relationship between codons and amino acids, recapitualing the overall structure of the genetic code. In addition to outperforming state-of-the-art genomic foundation models in a variety of zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks, the larger pre-trained models were superior in predicting the choice of synonymous codons. To systematically assess the impact of synonymous codon choices on protein expression and our models ability to capture these effects, we generated a large dataset measuring overall and surface expression levels of three proteins as a function of changes in their synonymous codons. We showed that our EnCodon models could be readily fine-tuned to predict the contextual consequences of synonymous codon choices. Armed with this knowledge, we applied EnCodon to existing clinical datasets of synonymous variants, and we identified a large number of synonymous codons that are likely pathogenic, several of which we experimentally confirmed in a cellbased model. Together, our findings establish the cdsFM suite as a powerful tool for decoding the complex functional grammar underlying the choice of synonymous codons",biorxiv
"Geographic and seasonal variation of the for gene reveal signatures of local adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster
==========
Geographic variation of the for gene reveals signatures of local adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster","In the early 1980s, the observation that Drosophila melanogaster larvae differed in their foraging behavior laid the foundation for the work that would later lead to the discovery of the foraging gene (for) and its associated foraging phenotypes, rover and sitter. Since then, the molecular characterization of the for gene and our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain its phenotypic variants in the laboratory have progressed enormously. However, the significance and dynamics of such variation are yet to be investigated in nature. With the advent of next-generation sequencing, it is now possible to identify loci underlying adaptation of populations in response to environmental variation. Here, I present results of a genotype-environment association analysis that quantifies variation at the for gene among samples of D. melanogaster structured across space and time. These samples consist of published genomes of adult flies collected worldwide, and at least twice per site of collection (during spring and fall). Both an analysis of genetic differentiation based on Fst values, and an analysis of population structure revealed an east-west gradient in allele frequency. This gradient may be the result of spatially varying selection driven by the seasonality of precipitation. These results support the hypothesis that different patterns of gene flow as expected under models of isolation by distance and potentially isolation by environment are driving genetic differentiation among populations. Overall, this study is essential for understanding the mechanisms underlying the evolution of foraging behavior in D. melanogaster",biorxiv
Gpmb-yolo: a lightweight model for efficient blood cell detection in medical imaging,"In the field of biomedical science, blood cell detection in microscopic images is crucial for aiding physicians in diagnosing blood-related diseases and plays a pivotal role in advancing medicine toward more precise and efficient treatment directions. Addressing the time-consuming and error-prone issues of traditional manual detection methods, as well as the challenge existing blood cell detection technologies face in meeting both high accuracy and real-time requirements, this study proposes a lightweight blood cell detection model based on YOLOv8n, named GPMB-YOLO. This model utilizes advanced lightweight strategies and PGhostC2f design, effectively reducing model complexity and enhancing detection speed. The integration of the simple parameter-free attention mechanism (SimAM) significantly enhances the model's feature extraction ability. Furthermore, we have designed a multidimensional attention-enhanced bidirectional feature pyramid network structure, MCA-BiFPN, optimizing the effect of multi-scale feature fusion. And use genetic algorithms for hyperparameter optimization, further improving detection accuracy. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the GPMB-YOLO model, which realized a 3.2% increase in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to the baseline YOLOv8n model and a marked reduction in model complexity. Furthermore, we have developed a blood cell detection system and deployed the model for application. This study serves as a valuable reference for the efficient detection of blood cells in medical images",PubMed
Female Sex Determination Factors in Ceratitis capitata: Molecular and Structural Basis of TRA and TRA2 Recognition,"In the model system for genetics, Drosophila melanogaster, sexual differentiation and male courtship behavior are controlled by sex-specific splicing of doublesex (dsx) and fruitless (fru). In vitro and in vivo studies showed that female-specific Transformer (TRA) and the non-sex-specific Transformer 2 (TRA2) splicing factors interact, forming a complex promoting dsx and fru female-specific splicing. TRA/TRA2 complex binds to 13 nt long sequence repeats in their pre-mRNAs. In the Mediterranean fruitfly Ceratitis capitata (Medfly), a major agricultural pest, which shares with Drosophila a ~120 million years old ancestor, Cctra and Cctra2 genes seem to promote female-specific splicing of Ccdsx and Ccfru, which contain conserved TRA/TRA2 binding repeats. Unlike Drosophila tra, Cctra autoregulates its female-specific splicing through these putative regulatory repeats. Here, a yeast two-hybrid assay shows that CcTRA interacts with CcTRA2, despite its high amino acid divergence compared to Drosophila TRA. Interestingly, CcTRA2 interacts with itself, as also observed for Drosophila TRA2. We also generated a three-dimensional model of the complex formed by CcTRA and CcTRA2 using predictive approaches based on Artificial Intelligence. This structure also identified an evolutionary and highly conserved putative TRA2 recognition motif in the TRA sequence. The Y2H approach, combined with powerful predictive tools of three-dimensional protein structures, could use helpful also in this and other insect species to understand the potential links between different upstream proteins acting as primary sex-determining signals and the conserved TRA and TRA2 transducers",PubMed
VarChat: the generative AI assistant for the interpretation of human genomic variations,"In the modern era of genomic research, the scientific community is witnessing an explosive growth in the volume of published findings. While this abundance of data offers invaluable insights, it also places a pressing responsibility on genetic professionals and researchers to stay informed about the latest findings and their clinical significance. Genomic variant interpretation is currently facing a challenge in identifying the most up-to-date and relevant scientific papers, while also extracting meaningful information to accelerate the process from clinical assessment to reporting. Computer-aided literature search and summarization can play a pivotal role in this context. By synthesizing complex genomic findings into concise, interpretable summaries, this approach facilitates the translation of extensive genomic datasets into clinically relevant insights.

Artificial Intelligence and Multiple Sclerosis,"In this paper, we analyse the different advances in artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in multiple sclerosis (MS). AI applications in MS range across investigation of disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. A subset of AI, Machine learning (ML) models analyse various data sources, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), genetic, and clinical data, to distinguish MS from other conditions, predict disease progression, and personalize treatment strategies. Additionally, AI models have been extensively applied to lesion segmentation, identification of biomarkers, and prediction of outcomes, disease monitoring, and management. Despite the big promises of AI solutions, model interpretability and transparency remain critical for gaining clinician and patient trust in these methods. The future of AI in MS holds potential for open data initiatives that could feed ML models and increasing generalizability, the implementation of federated learning solutions for training the models addressing data sharing issues, and generative AI approaches to address challenges in model interpretability, and transparency. In conclusion, AI presents an opportunity to advance our understanding and management of MS. AI promises to aid clinicians in MS diagnosis and prognosis improving patient outcomes and quality of life, however ensuring the interpretability and transparency of AI-generated results is going to be key for facilitating the integration of AI into clinical practice",PubMed
A new AI-assisted data standard accelerates interoperability in biomedical research,"In this paper, we leveraged Large Language Models(LLMs) to accelerate data wrangling and automate labor-intensive aspects of data discovery and harmonization. This work promotes interoperability standards and enhances data discovery, facilitating AI-readiness in biomedical science with the generation of Common Data Elements (CDEs) as key to harmonizing multiple datasets. Thirty-one studies, various ontologies, and medical coding systems served as source material to create CDEs from which available metadata and context was sent as an API request to 4th-generation OpenAI GPT models to populate each metadata field. A human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach was used to assess quality and accuracy of the generated CDEs. To regulate CDE generation, we employed ElasticSearch and HITL to avoid duplicate CDEs and instead, added them as potential aliases for existing CDEs. The generated CDEs are foundational to assess the interoperability potential of datasets by determining how many data set column headers can be correctly mapped to CDEs as well as quantifying compliance with permissible values and data types. Subject matter experts reviewed generated CDEs and determined that 94.0% of generated metadata fields did not require manual revisions. Data tables from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Global Parkinsons Genetic Program (GP2) were used as test cases for interoperability assessments. Column headers from all test cases were successfully mapped to generated CDEs at a rate of 32.4% via elastic search.The interoperability score, a metric for dataset compatibility to CDEs and other connected datasets, based on relevant criteria such as data field completeness and compliance with common harmonization standards averaged 53.8 out of 100 for test cases. With this project, we aim to automate the most tedious aspects of data harmonization, enhancing efficiency and scalability in biomedical research while decreasing activation energy for federated research

Investigating Concomitant RAG-2 and LRBA Mutations in SCID and Autoimmunity,"Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are a large heterogenous group of diseases characterized by immunodeficiency, immune dysregulation, allergy, auto-inflammation and predisposition for malignancies. Most are inherited in an autosomal recessive trait. We studied a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and immune dysregulation who harbored two distinct bi-allelic IEI-associated genetic mutations. Clinical, immunological and genetic data were collected. Genetic investigation included whole exome sequencing on DNA extracted from skin fibroblasts. Family segregation was performed by Sanger sequencing. Immunological evaluation included absolute and functional evaluation of lymphocytes and chimerism analysis post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Treg subsets, LRBA and CTLA4 expression levels were measured by flow-cytometric analysis. A nineteen-year-old female patient from a consanguine background underwent unconditioned matched sibling related HSCT during infancy due to clinical presentation of SCID with an Omenn phenotype. At that time her underlying genetic defect was not defined. Years after HSCT, severe auto-immune phenomena were noted, including a systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome and ophthalmic manifestations. Genetic evaluation revealed bi-allelic homozygous mutations in RAG-2 (c.685C>T, p.Arg229Trp) and a previously undescribed mutation in LRBA (c.3325G>T, p.Asp1109Tyr). LRBA and CTLA4 expression levels were normal, suggesting that the LRBA variant identified in these kindred is unlikely to be pathogenic. Multiple genetic defects causing complex IEIs may be identified in the same individual in highly consanguineous populations. Functional immunological testing is essential for evaluation of novel genetic variants",PubMed
Uptake of Cancer Genetic Services for Chatbot vs Standard-of-Care Delivery Models: The BRIDGE Randomized Clinical Trial,"Increasing numbers of unaffected individuals could benefit from genetic evaluation for inherited cancer susceptibility. Automated conversational agents (ie, chatbots) are being developed for cancer genetics contexts; however, randomized comparisons with standard of care (SOC) are needed. To examine whether chatbot and SOC approaches are equivalent in completion of pretest cancer genetic services and genetic testing. This equivalence trial (Broadening the Reach, Impact, and Delivery of Genetic Services [BRIDGE] randomized clinical trial) was conducted between August 15, 2020, and August 31, 2023, at 2 US health care systems (University of Utah Health and NYU Langone Health). Participants were aged 25 to 60 years, had had a primary care visit in the previous 3 years, were eligible for cancer genetic evaluation, were English or Spanish speaking, had no prior cancer diagnosis other than nonmelanoma skin cancer, had no prior cancer genetic counseling or testing, and had an electronic patient portal account. Participants were randomized 1:1 at the patient level to the study groups at each site. In the chatbot intervention group, patients were invited in a patient portal outreach message to complete a pretest genetics education chat. In the enhanced SOC control group, patients were invited to complete an SOC pretest appointment with a certified genetic counselor. Primary outcomes were completion of pretest cancer genetic services (ie, pretest genetics education chat or pretest genetic counseling appointment) and completion of genetic testing. Equivalence hypothesis testing was used to compare the study groups. This study included 3073 patients (1554 in the chatbot group and 1519 in the enhanced SOC control group). Their mean (SD) age at outreach was 43.8 (9.9) years, and most (2233 of 3063 [72.9%]) were women. A total of 204 patients (7.3%) were Black, 317 (11.4%) were Latinx, and 2094 (75.0%) were White. The estimated percentage point difference for completion of pretest cancer genetic services between groups was 2.0 (95% CI, -1.1 to 5.0). The estimated percentage point difference for completion of genetic testing was -1.3 (95% CI, -3.7 to 1.1). Analyses suggested equivalence in the primary outcomes. The findings of the BRIDGE equivalence trial support the use of chatbot approaches to offer cancer genetic services. Chatbot tools can be a key component of sustainable and scalable population health management strategies to enhance access to cancer genetic services.

GestaltMML: Enhancing Rare Genetic Disease Diagnosis through Multimodal Machine Learning Combining Facial Images and Clinical Texts,"Individuals with suspected rare genetic disorders often undergo multiple clinical evaluations, imaging studies, laboratory tests and genetic tests, to find a possible answer over a prolonged period of time. Addressing this ""diagnostic odyssey"" thus has substantial clinical, psychosocial, and economic benefits. Many rare genetic diseases have distinctive facial features, which can be used by artificial intelligence algorithms to facilitate clinical diagnosis, in prioritizing candidate diseases to be further examined by lab tests or genetic assays, or in helping the phenotype-driven reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data. Existing methods using frontal facial photos were built on conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), rely exclusively on facial images, and cannot capture non-facial phenotypic traits and demographic information essential for guiding accurate diagnoses. Here we introduce GestaltMML, a multimodal machine learning (MML) approach solely based on the Transformer architecture. It integrates facial images, demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity), and clinical notes (optionally, a list of Human Phenotype Ontology terms) to improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we also evaluated GestaltMML on a diverse range of datasets, including 528 diseases from the GestaltMatcher Database, several in-house datasets of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS, over-growth syndrome with distinct facial features), Sotos syndrome (overgrowth syndrome with overlapping features with BWS), NAA10-related neurodevelopmental syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome), and KBG syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome). Our results suggest that GestaltMML effectively incorporates multiple modalities of data, greatly narrowing candidate genetic diagnoses of rare diseases and may facilitate the reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data","PubMed,arXiv"
"Disorganized Inhibitory Dynamics and Functional Connectivity in Hippocampal area CA1 of 22q11.2 Deletion Mutant Mice

Disorganized Inhibitory Dynamics in Hippocampal area CA1 of 22q11.2 Deletion Mutant Mice","Individuals with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, one of the strongest genetic risk factors for schizophrenia, demonstrate cognitive impairments including episodic memory dysfunction. Place cell activity of excitatory pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus supporting episodic memory are impaired in a mouse model for the 22q11.2 deletion (Df(16)A+/-). While excitatory dynamics are under tight inhibitory control by multiple subtypes of GABAergic interneurons, previous studies have predominantly focused on a single subtype of PV-expressing interneurons; there have not yet been studies describing the functional relationships between molecularly identified inhibitory types in Df(16)A+/- mice. Here, we examined interneuron subtype-specific activity dynamics in the dorsal hippocampal area CA1 of Df(16)A+/- mice during random foraging and spatial reward learning tasks. Capitalizing on 3D acousto-optical deflector two-photon microscopy with post hoc immunohistochemical identification, we found that multiple interneuron types exhibit aberrant responses to reward locations and delayed reward enrichment extinction. Df(16)A+/- inhibitory interneurons also carry markedly reduced spatial information in a subtype-dependent manner. We observed task-dependent changes in the correlation structure and coactivity among multiple GABAergic subtypes, suggesting a broadly disorganized microcircuit functionality in mutant mice. Overall, we identify widespread and heterogeneous subtype-specific alterations in interneuron dynamics during spatial reward learning, reflecting impaired flexibility and organization in CA1 inhibitory microcircuits. Our study provides critical insights into how schizophrenia-risk mutations affect local-circuit interactions among diverse cell types in the mouse hippocampus during learning and spatial navigation",biorxiv
Application of machine learning based genome sequence analysis in pathogen identification,"Infectious diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms pose a serious threat to human health. Despite advances in molecular biology, genetics, computation, and medicinal chemistry, infectious diseases remain a significant public health concern. Addressing the challenges posed by pathogen outbreaks, pandemics, and antimicrobial resistance requires concerted interdisciplinary efforts. With the development of computer technology and the continuous exploration of artificial intelligence(AI)applications in the biomedical field, the automatic morphological recognition and image processing of microbial images under microscopes have advanced rapidly. The research team of Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed a single cell microbial identification technology combining Raman spectroscopy and artificial intelligence. Through laser Raman acquisition system and convolutional neural network analysis, the average accuracy rate of 95.64% has been achieved, and the identification can be completed in only 5 min. These technologies have shown substantial advantages in the visible morphological detection of pathogenic microorganisms, expanding anti-infective drug discovery, enhancing our understanding of infection biology, and accelerating the development of diagnostics. In this review, we discuss the application of AI-based machine learning in image analysis, genome sequencing data analysis, and natural language processing (NLP) for pathogen identification, highlighting the significant role of artificial intelligence in pathogen diagnosis. AI can improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis, promote early detection and personalized treatment, and enhance public health safety",PubMed
Auto- and paracrine rewiring of NIX-mediated mitophagy by insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 in septic AKI escalates inflammation-coupling tubular damage,"Inflammation-coupling tubular damage (ICTD) contributes to pathogenesis of septic acute kidney injury (AKI), in which insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP-7) serves as a biomarker for risk stratification. The current study aims to discern how IGFBP-7 signalling influences ICTD, the mechanisms that underlie this process and whether blockade of the IGFBP-7-dependent ICTD might have therapeutic value for septic AKI. In vivo characterization was carried out in B6/JGpt-Igfbp7<sup>em1Cd1165</sup>/Gpt mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, immunoblotting, ELISA, RT-qPCR and dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to determine mitochondrial functions, cell apoptosis, cytokine secretion and gene transcription. ICTD augments the transcriptional activity and protein secretion of tubular IGFBP-7, which enables an auto- and paracrine signalling via deactivation of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R). Genetic knockout (KO) of IGFBP-7 provides renal protection, improves survival and resolves inflammation in murine models of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), while administering recombinant IGFBP-7 aggravates ICTD and inflammatory invasion. IGFBP-7 perpetuates ICTD in a NIX/BNIP3-indispensable fashion through dampening mitophagy that restricts redox robustness and preserves mitochondrial clearance programs. Adeno-associated viral vector 9 (AAV9)-NIX short hairpin RNA (shRNA) delivery ameliorates the anti-septic AKI phenotypes of IGFBP-7 KO. Activation of BNIP3-mediated mitophagy by mitochonic acid-5 (MA-5) effectively attenuates the IGFBP-7-dependent ICTD and septic AKI in CLP mice. Our findings identify IGFBP-7 is an auto- and paracrine manipulator of NIX-mediated mitophagy for ICTD escalation and propose that targeting the IGFBP-7-dependent ICTD represents a novel therapeutic strategy against septic AKI",PubMed
Untangling the Role of Pathobionts from Bacteroides Species in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) arise from a convergence of underlying genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and shifts in gut microbiota function and membership. Although the latter may trigger and contribute to IBD, there is little consensus on a specific causative pathogen. In this study, we demonstrate that commensal Bacteroides fragilis strains from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients before and during the development of ileal pouchitis engraft and promote colitis in specific pathogen free (SPF) IL-10 deficient (IL-10-/-) mice, but not in wild type SPF mice or when mono-associated in germ free mice. The colitis in IL-10-/- mice was also associated with significant alterations in commensal microbiota potentially important for maintaining intestinal and immune homeostasis. UC pouchitis B. fragilis also engrafts in DSS-induced colitis in WT SPF mice, indicating a fitness advantage under conditions of mucosal inflammation over other commensals in the gut microbiota. These findings show that gut inflammation promotes the expansion and fitness of UC-derived Bacteroides species that is associated with changes in the SPF gut microbiota and may be promote colitis in genetically susceptible hosts.  ImportanceThis study supports the notion that human inflammatory bowel diseases arise from the emergence of indigenous pathobionts in genetically-prone subjects. Colitis-promoting pathobionts are well-suited to establish themselves in the host inflammatory environment and outcompete endogenous microbiota. Once engrafted, the pathobiont can further aggravate inflammation in a genetically-susceptible host. Such complex interplay among several factors creates a vicious pro-inflammatory cycle and promotes disease development. These findings are consistent with our previous clinical observation that B. fragilis, an otherwise low-abundance commensal species, expands prior to the development of UC pouchitis. We believe these findings are relevant to the pathogenesis of UC pouchitis and possibly human inflammatory bowel diseases in general, underscoring the role of commensal to pathobiont transitions, rather than classical pathogens, in promoting and exacerbating the onset of human IBD",biorxiv
ChatGPT for phenotypes extraction: one model to rule them all?,"Information Extraction (IE) is a core task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) where the objective is to identify factual knowledge in textual documents (often unstructured), and feed downstream use cases with the resulting output. In genomic medicine for instance, being able to extract the most precise list of phenotypes associated to a patient allows to improve genetic disease diagnostic, which represents a vital step in the modern deep phenotyping approach. As most of the phenotypic information lies in clinical reports, the challenge is to build an IE pipeline to automatically recognize phenotype concepts from free-text notes. A new machine learning paradigm around large language models (LLM) has given rise of an increasing number of academic works on this topic lately, where sophisticated combinations of different technics have been employed to improve the phenotypes extraction accuracy. Even more recently released, the ChatGPT<sup>1</sup> application nevertheless raises the question of the relevance of these approches compared to this new generic one based on an instruction-oriented LLM. In this paper, we propose a rigorous evaluation of ChatGPT and the current state-of-the-art solutions on this specific task, and discuss the possible impacts and the technical evolutions to consider in the medical domain.Clinical relevance- Deep phenotyping on electronic health records has proven its ability to improve genetic diagnosis by clinical exomes [10].

Biomedical Information Integration via Adaptive Large Language Model Construction,"Integrating diverse biomedical knowledge information is essential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnoses, facilitate personalized treatment plans, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. However, Biomedical Information Integration (BII) faces significant challenges due to variations in terminology and the complex structure of entity descriptions across different datasets. A critical step in BII is biomedical entity alignment, which involves accurately identifying and matching equivalent entities across diverse datasets to ensure seamless data integration. In recent years, Large Language Model (LLMs), such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERTs), have emerged as valuable tools for discerning heterogeneous biomedical data due to their deep contextual embeddings and bidirectionality. However, different LLMs capture various nuances and complexity levels within the biomedical data, and none of them can ensure their effectiveness in all heterogeneous entity matching tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel Two-Stage LLM construction (TSLLM) framework to adaptively select and combine LLMs for Biomedical Information Integration (BII). First, a Multi-Objective Genetic Programming (MOGP) algorithm is proposed for generating versatile high-level LLMs, and then, a Single-Objective Genetic Algorithm (SOGA) employs a confidence-based strategy is presented to combine the built LLMs, which can further improve the discriminative power of distinguishing heterogeneous entities. The experiment utilizes OAEI's entity matching datasets, i.e., Benchmark and Conference, along with LargeBio, Disease and Phenotype datasets to test the performance of TSLLM. The experimental findings validate the efficiency of TSLLM in adaptively differentiating heterogeneous biomedical entities, which significantly outperforms the leading entity matching techniques",PubMed
Multi-Omics Integration Analysis Pinpoint Proteins Influencing Brain Structure and Function: Toward Drug Targets and Neuroimaging Biomarkers for Neuropsychiatric Disorders,"Integrating protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) data and summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of brain image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) can benefit in identifying IDP-related proteins. Here, we developed a systematic omics-integration analytic framework by sequentially using proteome-wide association study (PWAS), Mendelian randomization (MR), and colocalization (COLOC) analyses to identify the potentially causal brain and plasma proteins for IDPs, followed by pleiotropy analysis, mediation analysis, and drug exploration analysis to investigate potential mediation pathways of pleiotropic proteins to neuropsychiatric disorders (NDs) as well as candidate drug targets. A total of 201 plasma proteins and 398 brain proteins were significantly associated with IDPs from PWAS analysis. Subsequent MR and COLOC analyses further identified 313 potentially causal IDP-related proteins, which were significantly enriched in neural-related phenotypes, among which 91 were further identified as pleiotropic proteins associated with both IDPs and NDs, including EGFR, TMEM106B, GPT, and HLA-B. Drug prioritization analysis showed that 6.33% of unique pleiotropic proteins had drug targets or interactions with medications for NDs. Nine potential mediation pathways were identified to illustrate the mediating roles of the IDPs in the causal effect of the pleiotropic proteins on NDs, including the indirect effect of TMEM106B on Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk via radial diffusivity (RD) of the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC), with the mediation proportion being 11.18%, and the indirect effect of EGFR on AD through RD of PLIC, RD of splenium of corpus callosum (SCC), and fractional anisotropy (FA) of SCC, with the mediation proportion being 18.99%, 22.79%, and 19.91%, respectively. These findings provide novel insights into pathogenesis, drug targets, and neuroimaging biomarkers of NDs",PubMed
RAG genomic variation causes autoimmune diseases through specific structure-based mechanisms of enzyme dysregulation,"Interpreting genetic changes observed in individual patients is a critical challenge. The array of immune deficiency syndromes is typically caused by genetic variation unique to individuals. Therefore, new approaches are needed to interpret functional variation and accelerate genomics interpretation. We constructed the first full-length structural model of human RAG recombinase across four functional states of the recombination process. We functionally tested 182 clinically observed RAG missense mutations. These experiments revealed dysfunction due to recombinase dysfunction and altered chromatin interactions. Structural modeling identified mechanical and energetic roles for each mutation. We built regression models for RAG1 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91) and RAG2 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97) to predict RAG activity changes. We applied our model to 711 additional RAG variants observed in population studies and identified a subset that may impair RAG function.

The Future of Patient Education: AI-Driven Guide for Type 2 Diabetes,"Introduction and aim The surging incidence of type 2 diabetes has become a growing concern for the healthcare sector. This chronic ailment, characterized by its complex blend of genetic and lifestyle determinants, has witnessed a notable increase in recent times, exerting substantial pressure on healthcare resources. As more individuals turn to online platforms for health guidance and embrace the utilization of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT; San Francisco, CA: OpenAI), a text-generating AI (TGAI), to get insights into their well-being, evaluating its effectiveness and reliability becomes crucial. This research primarily aimed to evaluate the correctness of TGAI responses to type 2 diabetes (T2DM) inquiries via ChatGPT. Furthermore, this study aimed to examine the consistency of TGAI in addressing common queries on T2DM complications for patient education. Material and methods Questions on T2DM were formulated by experienced physicians and screened by research personnel before querying ChatGPT. Each question was posed thrice, and the collected answers were summarized. Responses were then sorted into three distinct categories as follows: (a) appropriate, (b) inappropriate, and (c) unreliable by two seasoned physicians. In instances of differing opinions, a third physician was consulted to achieve consensus. Results From the initial set of 110 T2DM questions, 40 were dismissed by experts for relevance, resulting in a final count of 70. An overwhelming 98.5% of the AI's answers were judged as appropriate, thus underscoring its reliability over traditional online search engines. Nonetheless, a 1.5% rate of inappropriate responses underlines the importance of ongoing AI improvements and strict adherence to medical protocols. Conclusion TGAI provides medical information of high quality and reliability. This study underscores TGAI's impressive effectiveness in delivering reliable information about T2DM, with 98.5% of responses aligning with the standard of care. These results hold promise for integrating AI platforms as supplementary tools to enhance patient education and outcomes",PubMed
Investigation of risk factors for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) using a population-based case-control study as part of the 2015-2018 screening program in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmad province in southwestern Iran,"Introduction and objectivesCongenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a lack of thyroid hormone at birth, crucial for brain development. A nationwide screening program has been implemented in Iran since 2005, resulting in over 12 million infants being screened and more than 30,000 patients diagnosed and treated. The incidence of CH in Iran is 2.7 per thousand live births, which is higher compared to the global incidence of 1 in 3,000 to 4,000. The incidence of CH in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmad province is significantly higher than the national and global incidence. Prognostic factors including twins, the season of birth, puberty, jaundice at birth, birth weight, gestational age, anemia and goiter of the mother, type of delivery, fathers education, and smoking status are significantly associated with CH. Genetic, climatic, and environmental factors also play a role in the development of CH. Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is one of the most common causes of intellectual disability, which can be prevented if diagnosed and treated on time. We aimed to investigate some related risk factors for CH in infants born in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmad province.  ResultsThis was a population-based case-control study conducted on 270 infants. The study population included infants who were born between 2015 and 2018 and were subjected to a screening program for CH. In general, 135 infants diagnosed with CH who were confirmed by a specialist and had a medical record were considered as the case group and the rest (135 infants) who were healthy were considered as controls. Patients and control infants were matched in a one-to-one ratio. Information was extracted from the Sib Health Integrated System (http://sib.yums.ac.ir). Regression analysis using the logistic regression method was performed on data collected from a sample of 270 infants and SPSS software version 24 was used to analyze the data with P<0.05 considered significant. Ethical considerations were addressed by obtaining approval from the ethics committee of Yasuj University of Medical Sciences under ethical number IR.YUMS.REC.1397.136 and holding preliminary meetings with authorities, health, and medical personnel to discuss different tasks, collaboration, and completion of checklists.  ConclusionThe results of the study show that among the cases studied, 3 factors, weight and height of the infant at birth and a family history of the disease in the infant could be the main risk factors for hypothyroidism (CH) in this province. Other factors such as birth order (rank), maternal age, maternal weight and height, age and mode of delivery, history of medication and iodized salt intake in the mother, diseases of the mother and father, and familial relationship of the parents were not observed to have a statistically significant association with CH. further studies are needed to analyze the results of the present study to establish the causality of these associations with greater certainty",medrxiv
Diagnosing hyperglycemia (GDM) in pregnancy: closing the door after the horse has bolted?,"IntroductionGestational diabetes (GDM) increases risk of diabetes and obesity (diabesity) in the offspring. However, intensive treatment of GDM (generally diagnosed late in pregnancy) has failed to reduce these outcomes in RCTs. The vital window for programming of diabesity is pre- and peri-conceptional, and is influenced by maternal metabolism. Though it is known that metabolic-endocrine abnormalities of  GDM may be detectable before pregnancy, there is little data on the life course precursors of pregnancy hyperglycemia.  MethodsThe Pune Maternal Nutrition Study birth cohort was set up in 1993-96. 171/366 females born in the study had married and delivered a baby by Feb 2020. We have serial glycemic and body size data for these women at age 6, 12 and 18y, in pregnancy, and post-delivery.  ResultsAt 28-wks gestation the mothers were 21y old, their median BMI 22 kg/m2, and twenty had GDM (IADPSG). Given the small number of GDM, we called the 4th quartile of FPG ([&ge;]4.7 mmol/l, N=44)  fasting hyperglycemic and compared the serial fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of these with the remaining 126 ( normoglycemic). Women with fasting hyperglycemia had higher FPG at 6, 12 and 18-years and post-delivery, and higher HbA1c before pregnancy. Women with fasting hyperglycemia were thin as a group, but they had higher BMI and waist circumference throughout compared to normoglycemic.  InterpretationPregnancy glycemia reflects glycemia throughout childhood and adolescence. Diagnosing GDM in pregnancy ignores exposure of the ovum and the embryo to an abnormal metabolic milieu and fails to influence the periconceptional programming of diabesity. Diagnosing and treating GDM in late pregnancy will not curtail the escalating epidemic of diabesity in the young.  Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSMost clinicians and researchers believe that  gestational diabetes comes during pregnancy and goes away after delivery. The current practice is to diagnose GDM by an OGTT between 24-28 weeks though some suggest earlier diagnosis (at booking visit), especially in those at higher risk. Several studies, either by design or access to previous opportunistic investigation have reported higher glucose, HbA1c, lipids, and BMI years before diagnosis of GDM. A few cohorts have also reported higher glucose and HbA1c before pregnancy in those subsequently diagnosed with GDM. These markers have mostly been classified as  risk factors for GDM, without considering the possibility that a disorder was already present before pregnancy. On the other hand, a few epidemiologists have asserted that GDM is pre-gestational but this has not been much acknowledged and has not influenced clinical practice.  Maternal hyperglycemia adversely influences pregnancy outcomes, and increases long-term risk of diabetes and obesity in the offspring (as well as in the mother). Randomised controlled trials of intensive glycemic control in pregnancy (usually initiated in the third trimester, sometimes earlier) prevent some of the short-term pregnancy outcomes but not the long-term risk of diabetes and obesity in the offspring. This may be due to genetic transmission but more likely due to pre- and peri-conceptional  epigenetic programming. Programming is influenced by the metabolic milieu of the ova and the conceptus which includes maternal metabolites, nutrients etc. This crucial period is systematically missed in the current clinical management of GDM  Our literature search revealed no study which has reported the life-course evolution of pregnancy glycemia which will have a bearing on the pre- and periconceptional programming of diabetes in the offspring.  Added value of this studyWe describe for the first time a life course trajectory of glycemia in women born in a rural preconceptional birth cohort in India 30 years ago, followed throughout childhood and adolescence, marriage and pregnancy and developed gestational fasting hyperglycemia. We start with their exposure to maternal glycemia during intrauterine life, and track their consistently elevated glycemic curve from childhood into puberty, young adulthood, pregnancy, and post-pregnancy compared to that of women with  normal pregnancy glycemia. This demonstrates that the hyperglycemic womens ova and conceptus would be exposed to higher glucose concentrations and that hyperglycemia in pregnancy is only a window in the life course and not a de novo phenomenon. The glycemic separation between the two groups was exaggerated during the post-delivery follow-up, pushing these women towards type 2 diabetes.  Implications of all the available evidenceWe provide proof that gestational hyperglycemia (GDM) is not only  gestational but is a continuation of elevated glycemia from early life. This has implications not only for the diagnosis and treatment of  GDM to improve pregnancy outcomes but especially for the primordial prevention of the intergenerational programming of the diabetes epidemic. Our results suggest that hyperglycemia in young women should be diagnosed and controlled before pregnancy to curtail pre- and peri-conceptional programming of diabetes. This will shift the focus from the clinic to the community, from clinical medicine to public health. Further research will define the role of genetic and epigenetic factors involved",medrxiv
AI-Powered Test Question Generation in Medical Education: The DailyMed Approach,"IntroductionLarge language models (LLMs) presents opportunities to improve the efficiency and quality of tools in medical education, such as the generation of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, ensuring that these questions are clinically relevant, accurate, and easily accesible and reusable remains challenging. Here, we developed DailyMed, an online automated pipeline using LLMs to generate high-quality medical MCQs.  MethodsOur DailyMed pipeline involves several key steps: 1) topic generation, 2) question creation, 3) validation using Semantic Scholar, 4) difficulty grading, 5) iterative improvement of simpler questions, and 6) final human review. The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique was applied to enhance LLM reasoning. Three state-of the art LLMs--OpenBioLLM-70B, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet--were evaluated within the area of clinical genetics, and the generated questions were rated by clinical experts for validity, clarity, originality, relevance, and difficulty.  ResultsGPT-4o produced the highest-rated questions, excelling in validity, originality, clarity, and relevance. Although OpenBioLLM was more cost-efficient, it consistently scored lower in all categories. GPT-4o also achieved the greatest topic diversity (89.8%), followed by Claude Sonnet (86.9%) and OpenBioLLM (80.0%). In terms of cost and performance, GPT-4o was the most efficient model, with an average cost of $0.51 per quiz and a runtime of 16 seconds per question.  ConclusionsOur pipeline provides a scalable, effective and online-accessible solution for generating diverse, clinically relevant MCQs. GPT-4o demonstrated the highest overall performance, making it the preferred model for this task, while OpenBioLLM offers a cost-effective alternative",medrxiv
A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of Guanfacine Extended Release for aggression and self-injurious behavior associated with Prader-Willi Syndrome,"IntroductionPrader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), a rare genetic disorder, affects development and behavior, frequently resulting in self-injury, aggression, hyperphagia, oppositional behavior, impulsivity and over-activity causing significant morbidity. Currently, limited therapeutic options are available to manage these neuropsychiatric manifestations. The aim of this clinical trial was to assess the efficacy of guanfacine-extended release (GXR) in reducing aggression and self-injury in individuals with PWS.  Trial DesignRandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted under IRB approval.  MethodsSubjects with a diagnosis of PWS, 6-35 years of age, with moderate to severe aggressive and/or self-injurious behavior as determined by the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity scale, were included in an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-flexible dose clinical trial of GXR, that was followed by an 8-week open-label extension phase. Validated behavioral instruments and physician assessments measured the efficacy of GXR treatment, its safety and tolerability.  ResultsGXR was effective in reducing aggression/agitation and hyperactivity/noncompliance as measured by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) scales (p=0.03). Overall aberrant behavior scores significantly reduced in the GXR arm. Aggression as measured by the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) also showed a significant reduction. Skin-picking lesions as measured by the Self Injury Trauma (SIT) scale decreased in response to GXR. No serious adverse events were experienced by any of the study participants. Fatigue /sedation was the only adverse event significantly associated with GXR. The GXR group demonstrated significant overall clinical improvement as measured by the CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) scale. (p<0.01).  ConclusionFindings of this pragmatic trial strongly support the use of GXR for treatment of aggression, skin picking, and hyperactivity in children, adolescents, and adults with PWS.

"Rehabilitation with and without Robot and Allied Digital Technologies (RADTs) in stroke patients: a study protocol for a multicentre Randomised Controlled Trial on the effectiveness, acceptability, usability, and economic-organizational sustainability of RADTs from subacute to chronic phase (STROKEFIT4)","IntroductionRehabilitation after stroke often employs Robots and Allied Digital Technologies (RADTs). However, evidence of their effectiveness remains inconclusive due to study heterogeneity and limited sample sizes. Here, we describe a protocol for a multicentre randomized controlled pragmatic trial aimed at comprehensively and accurately assessing the effectiveness and sustainability of RADT-mediated rehabilitation, compared to traditional rehabilitation.  Methods and analysisThis is a pragmatic multicentre, multimodal, randomised, controlled, parallel-group (1:1) interventional study with blinded assessors. The trial will recruit 596 adult post-stroke patients in the subacute phase (less than 6 months post-stroke). Patients will be recruited from thirteen rehabilitation centres participating in a national research initiative, encompassing both outpatient and inpatient clinical settings. Participants will be randomized into either the experimental group, or the control group. The experimental group will receive rehabilitation using RADTs within a new organizational model, where two physical therapists supervise four to six patients; patients will undergo a comprehensive rehabilitation treatment, targeting the following domains: a) upper limb sensorimotor abilities; b) lower limb sensorimotor abilities and gait; c) balance; d) cognitive abilities. In the control group, patients will undergo individual traditional rehabilitation, maintaining a 1:1 patient-to-therapist ratio, targeting the same domains. Patients will undergo a total of 25 sessions, each lasting 45 minutes, with a frequency of 5 times a week, for inpatients; and 3 times a week, for outpatients. The primary endpoint is to demonstrate non-inferiority in the recovery of the activities of daily living as measured by the modified Barthel Index. If non-inferiority is established, the study will then evaluate the superiority of RADTs in the recovery of the activities of daily living. Secondary endpoints include improvements in upper and lower limb function, balance, cognitive function, and, according to the ICF, in the body functions, activities, and participation domains. Additional analyses will cover neurophysiological assessments of neural plasticity, as well as biochemical, and genetic evaluations. Upper limb dexterity and gait recovery rates during treatment will be monitored. The study will also evaluate daily activities and quality of life during a six-month follow-up period post-treatment. Acceptability and usability of integrated RADTs-based rehabilitation for patients, families, and healthcare providers, along with economic and organizational sustainability for patients, payers, and society, will also be assessed. Outcomes will be measured and analysed by blinded assessors.  Ethics and disseminationThis study was reviewed and approved by National Ethics Committee for clinical trials of Public Research Bodies (EPR) and other National Public Institutions (CEN). The results will be disseminated through scientific articles in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at both national and international conferences.  Trial registration numberNCT06547827  Strengths and limitations of this study* The effectiveness of robotics and allied technologies will be evaluated using a novel approach involving a multimodal intervention. This approach addresses all impaired functions to holistically enhance activities of daily living, which represent the patients most important needs. * In addition to clinical scales, neurophysiological and biochemical data will be considered for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor recovery. * Detailed patient profiling will enable the creation of predictive models to identify subjects who may respond better to treatment integrated with robotics and allied technologies. * The economic analysis will allow us to assess the sustainability of a new organizational model based on the use of robotics and allied technologies, where two physiotherapists supervise a group of patients simultaneously. * A study limitation is the use of different technologies across research centres. However, this reflects real-world conditions. To address the inevitable variability, we clearly defined the functional domains for treatment with robotic or technological systems, focusing on the lower limbs, balance, upper limb segments, and cognitive functions. Moreover, to manage other possible sources of variability due to the number of centres involved, a consensus was reached about clear protocols for clinical evaluation and therapy administration to be shared in clinical practice by all the participating centres",medrxiv
"Ketone Bodies in Right Ventricular Failure: A Unique Therapeutic Opportunity
==========
Ketone bodies in Right Ventricular Failure: A Unique Therapeutic Opportunity","Introductory ParagraphKetone bodies are pleotropic metabolites that play important roles in multiple biological processes ranging from bioenergetics to inflammation regulation via suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and epigenetic modifications. Ketone bodies are elevated in left ventricular failure (LVF) and multiple approaches that increase ketone concentrations exert advantageous cardiac effects in rodents and humans. However, the relationships between ketone bodies and right ventricular failure (RVF) are relatively unexplored. Moreover, the cardioprotective properties of ketones in preclinical RVF are unknown. Here, we show a compensatory ketosis is absent in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients with RVF. In the monocrotaline (MCT) rat model of PAH-mediated RVF, a dietary-induced ketosis improves RV function, suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and combats RV fibrosis. The summation of these data suggest ketogenic therapies may be particularly efficacious in RVF, and therefore future studies evaluating ketogenic interventions in human RVF are warranted",biorxiv
Chronic Staphylococcus aureus infection of osteocytes promotes an intracellular viable-but-non-culturable phenotype,"Introductory paragraphInfectious osteomyelitis is a potentially severe disease with an increased incidence of 10% over the last 10 years (1, 2) and a 20% recurrence rate creating chronic infections (3). Diagnosis and pathogen identification remain challenging, with culture-negative results in 7-39% of cases (4-6), of which 14-27% are PCR-positive from drained fluids (7). Of recent intensive research focus, osteomyelitis associated with Prosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) is a serious and growing complication of orthopaedic joint replacement surgery, with a failure to cure rate within 2-years internationally of between 15-46% (8, 9). Osteocytes act as potential long-term reservoirs for intracellular Staphylococcus aureus, protecting it against the immune responses and antimicrobial treatment (10-15). However, the intra-osteocytic adaptation mechanisms by S. aureus remain understudied, and it is unknown why so many infections are culture-negative but PCR-positive. Here, we found that in chronic intra-osteocytic infections, S. aureus consistently adopts a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state. Whole genome sequencing of parental and a revertant strain indicated that initially, S. aureus cells possessing TarP and a complete T7SS dominate the bacterial community but these cell numbers declined with genetic rearrangements seemingly linked with the shift to a VBNC state. The subsequent acquisition of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in srrB was associated with resuscitation to a culturable state, suggesting at least one mechanism underlying entrance and exit from the intracellular VBNC state",biorxiv
Targeted cancer therapy induces APOBEC fuelling the evolution of drug resistance,"Introductory paragraphThe clinical success of targeted cancer therapy is limited by drug resistance that renders cancers lethal in patients1-4. Human tumours can evolve therapy resistance by acquiring de novo genetic alterations and increased heterogeneity via mechanisms that remain incompletely understood1. Here, through parallel analysis of human clinical samples, tumour xenograft and cell line models and murine model systems, we uncover an unanticipated mechanism of therapy-induced adaptation that fuels the evolution of drug resistance. Targeted therapy directed against EGFR and ALK oncoproteins in lung cancer induced adaptations favoring apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide (APOBEC)-mediated genome mutagenesis. In human oncogenic EGFR-driven and ALK-driven lung cancers and preclinical models, EGFR or ALK inhibitor treatment induced the expression and DNA mutagenic activity of APOBEC3B via therapy-mediated activation of NF-{kappa}B signaling. Moreover, targeted therapy also mediated downregulation of certain DNA repair enzymes such as UNG2, which normally counteracts APOBEC-catalyzed DNA deamination events. In mutant EGFR-driven lung cancer mouse models, APOBEC3B was detrimental to tumour initiation and yet advantageous to tumour progression during EGFR targeted therapy, consistent with TRACERx data demonstrating subclonal enrichment of APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis. This study reveals how cancers adapt and drive genetic diversity in response to targeted therapy and identifies APOBEC deaminases as future targets for eliciting more durable clinical benefit to targeted cancer therapy",biorxiv
Shared and unique consequences of Joubert Syndrome gene dysfunction on the zebrafish central nervous system,"Joubert Syndrome (JBTS) is a neurodevelopmental ciliopathy defined by a highly specific midbrain-hindbrain malformation, variably associated with additional neurological features. JBTS displays prominent genetic heterogeneity with >40 causative genes that encode proteins localising to the primary cilium, a sensory organelle that is essential for transduction of signalling pathways during neurodevelopment, among other vital functions. JBTS proteins localise to distinct ciliary subcompartments, suggesting diverse functions in cilium biology. Currently, there is no unifying pathomechanism to explain how dysfunction of such diverse primary cilia-related proteins results in such a highly specific brain abnormality. In order to identify the shared consequence of JBTS gene dysfunction, we carried out transcriptomic analysis using zebrafish mutants for the JBTS-causative genes cc2d2auw38, cep290fh297, inpp5ezh506, talpid3i264 and togaram1zh510and the Bardet-Biedl syndrome-causative gene bbs1k742. We identified no commonly dysregulated signalling pathways in these mutants and yet all mutants displayed an enrichment of altered gene sets related to central nervous system function. We found that JBTS mutants have altered primary cilia throughout the brain, however do not display abnormal brain morphology. Nonetheless, behavioural analyses revealed reduced locomotion and loss of postural control which, together with the transcriptomic results, hint at underlying abnormalities in neuronal activity and/or neuronal circuit function. These zebrafish models therefore offer the unique opportunity to study the role of primary cilia in neuronal function beyond early patterning, proliferation and differentiation.  Summary StatementJoubert Syndrome gene dysfunction in zebrafish leads to abnormal brain cilia, altered transcription of neuron-associated genes and abnormal swimming behaviour despite normal brain morphology",biorxiv
Transposon mutagenesis screen in Klebsiella pneumoniae identifies genetic determinants required for growth in human urine and serum,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is a global public health concern due to the rising myriad of hypervirulent and multi-drug resistant clones both alarmingly associated with high mortality. The molecular microbial genetics underpinning these recalcitrant K. pneumoniae infections is unclear, coupled with the emergence of lineages resistant to nearly all present day clinically important antimicrobials. In this study, we performed a genome-wide screen in K. pneumoniae ECL8, a member of the endemic K2-ST375 pathotype most often reported in Asia, to define genes essential for growth in a nutrient-rich laboratory medium (Luria-Bertani medium), human urine and serum. Through transposon directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS), a total of 427 genes were identified as essential for growth on LB agar, whereas transposon insertions in 11 and 144 genes decreased fitness for growth in either urine or serum, respectively. These studies provide further knowledge on the genetics of this pathogen but also provide a strong impetus for discovering new antimicrobial targets to improve current therapeutic options for K. pneumoniae infections",biorxiv
Biochemical identification of prepubertal boys with Klinefelter syndrome by combined reproductive hormone profiling using machine learning,"Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the most common sex chromosome disorder and genetic cause of infertility in males. A highly variable phenotype contributes to the fact that a large proportion of cases are never diagnosed. Typical hallmarks in adults include small testes and azoospermia which may prompt biochemical evaluation that typically shows extremely high follicle-stimulating hormone and low/undetectable inhibin B serum concentrations. However, in prepubertal KS individuals, biochemical parameters are largely overlapping those of prepubertal controls. We aimed to characterize clinical profiles of prepubertal boys with KS in relation to controls and to develop a novel biochemical classification model to identify KS before puberty. Retrospective, longitudinal data from 15 prepubertal boys with KS and data from 1475 controls were used to calculate age- and sex-adjusted standard deviation scores (SDS) for height and serum concentrations of reproductive hormones and used to infer a decision tree classification model for KS. Individual reproductive hormones were low but within reference ranges and did not discriminate KS from controls. Clinical and biochemical profiles including age- and sex-adjusted SDS from multiple reference curves provided input data to train a 'random forest' machine learning (ML) model for the detection of KS. Applied to unseen data, the ML model achieved a classification accuracy of 78% (95% CI, 61-94%). Supervised ML applied to clinically relevant variables enabled computational classification of control and KS profiles. The application of age- and sex-adjusted SDS provided robust predictions irrespective of age. Specialized ML models applied to combined reproductive hormone concentrations may be useful diagnostic tools to improve the identification of prepubertal boys with KS",PubMed
Hematological and biochemical characterization of aging farm male rat strains in the national center for geriatrics and gerontology,"Laboratory rats, like mice, are a type of animal commonly used in scientific investigations as well as in basic aging and geriatric research. The selection of a rat strain is an important first step in the planning and design of an experiment due to physiological, anatomical, and ethological variations in each strain, which may significantly modify the expected results. In the present study, we characterized age-related changes, from 3 months old (mo) to 24 mo, in three male rat strains commonly used in medical research: RccHan<sup>®️</sup>:WIST (RccHan:WIST), F344/NSlc (F344), and Slc:SD Rat (SD). The body weight, water/food consumption, and survival rate of each strain were physiologically evaluated. Hematological and biochemical values were analyzed every three months. Hematological results showed a decrease in lymphocytes and increases in other leukocytes from 12 mo in F344 and SD rats. The incidence of hematological disorder was 10-15% in F344 and SD rats from 18 mo. Increases in hepatic biochemical parameters (alanine transaminase (GPT/ALT) and aspartate transaminase (GOT/AST)) and cytopathological parameters (creatine phosphokinase (CPK)) were observed in male F344 rats at 12 mo. Triglycerides (TG) serum levels were significantly elevated in the 12 mo RccHan:WIST rats, while Lipase (LIP) levels were significantly reduced in 24 mo. The present results revealed significant variations in hematological and biochemical values in the different laboratory male rat strains due to genetic and nutritional-metabolic factors specific to each strain",PubMed
Linguistic profile automated characterisation in pluripotential clinical high-risk mental state (CHARMS) conditions: methodology of a multicentre observational study,"Language is usually considered the social vehicle of thought in intersubjective communications. However, the relationship between language and high-order cognition seems to evade this canonical and unidirectional description (ie, the notion of language as a simple means of thought communication). In recent years, clinical high at-risk mental state (CHARMS) criteria (evolved from the Ultra-High-Risk paradigm) and the introduction of the Clinical Staging system have been proposed to address the dynamicity of early psychopathology. At the same time, natural language processing (NLP) techniques have greatly evolved and have been successfully applied to investigate different neuropsychiatric conditions. The combination of at-risk mental state paradigm, clinical staging system and automated NLP methods, the latter applied on spoken language transcripts, could represent a useful and convenient approach to the problem of early psychopathological distress within a transdiagnostic risk paradigm. Help-seeking young people presenting psychological distress (CHARMS+/- and Clinical Stage 1a or 1b; target sample size for both groups n=90) will be assessed through several psychometric tools and multiple speech analyses during an observational period of 1-year, in the context of an Italian multicentric study. Subjects will be enrolled in different contexts: Department of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health (DINOGMI), Section of Psychiatry, University of Genoa-IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy; Mental Health Department-territorial mental services (ASL 3-Genoa), Genoa, Italy; and Mental Health Department-territorial mental services (AUSL-Piacenza), Piacenza, Italy. The conversion rate to full-blown psychopathology (CS 2) will be evaluated over 2 years of clinical observation, to further confirm the predictive and discriminative value of CHARMS criteria and to verify the possibility of enriching them with several linguistic features, derived from a fine-grained automated linguistic analysis of speech. The methodology described in this study adheres to ethical principles as formulated in the Declaration of Helsinki and is compatible with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)-good clinical practice. The research protocol was reviewed and approved by two different ethics committees (CER Liguria approval code: 591/2020-id.10993; Comitato Etico dell'Area Vasta Emilia Nord approval code: 2022/0071963). Participants will provide their written informed consent prior to study enrolment and parental consent will be needed in the case of participants aged less than 18 years old. Experimental results will be carefully shared through publication in peer-reviewed journals, to ensure proper data reproducibility. DOI:10.17605/OSF.IO/BQZTN",PubMed
Detecting and Evaluating Medical Hallucinations in Large Vision Language Models,"Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly integral to healthcare applications, including medical visual question answering and imaging report generation. While these models inherit the robust capabilities of foundational Large Language Models (LLMs), they also inherit susceptibility to hallucinations-a significant concern in high-stakes medical contexts where the margin for error is minimal. However, currently, there are no dedicated methods or benchmarks for hallucination detection and evaluation in the medical field. To bridge this gap, we introduce Med-HallMark, the first benchmark specifically designed for hallucination detection and evaluation within the medical multimodal domain. This benchmark provides multi-tasking hallucination support, multifaceted hallucination data, and hierarchical hallucination categorization. Furthermore, we propose the MediHall Score, a new medical evaluative metric designed to assess LVLMs' hallucinations through a hierarchical scoring system that considers the severity and type of hallucination, thereby enabling a granular assessment of potential clinical impacts. We also present MediHallDetector, a novel Medical LVLM engineered for precise hallucination detection, which employs multitask training for hallucination detection. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we establish baselines for popular LVLMs using our benchmark. The findings indicate that MediHall Score provides a more nuanced understanding of hallucination impacts compared to traditional metrics and demonstrate the enhanced performance of MediHallDetector. We hope this work can significantly improve the reliability of LVLMs in medical applications. All resources of this work will be released soon",arXiv
"Evaluating large language models on medical, lay-language, and self-reported descriptions of genetic conditions","Large language models (LLMs) are generating interest in medical settings. For example, LLMs can respond coherently to medical queries by providing plausible differential diagnoses based on clinical notes. However, there are many questions to explore, such as evaluating differences between open- and closed-source LLMs as well as LLM performance on queries from both medical and non-medical users. In this study, we assessed multiple LLMs, including Llama-2-chat, Vicuna, Medllama2, Bard/Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT3.5, and ChatGPT-4, as well as non-LLM approaches (Google search and Phenomizer) regarding their ability to identify genetic conditions from textbook-like clinician questions and their corresponding layperson translations related to 63 genetic conditions. For open-source LLMs, larger models were more accurate than smaller LLMs: 7b, 13b, and larger than 33b parameter models obtained accuracy ranges from 21%-49%, 41%-51%, and 54%-68%, respectively. Closed-source LLMs outperformed open-source LLMs, with ChatGPT-4 performing best (89%-90%). Three of 11 LLMs and Google search had significant performance gaps between clinician and layperson prompts. We also evaluated how in-context prompting and keyword removal affected open-source LLM performance. Models were provided with 2 types of in-context prompts: list-type prompts, which improved LLM performance, and definition-type prompts, which did not. We further analyzed removal of rare terms from descriptions, which decreased accuracy for 5 of 7 evaluated LLMs. Finally, we observed much lower performance with real individuals' descriptions; LLMs answered these questions with a maximum 21% accuracy",PubMed
Testing and Evaluation of Health Care Applications of Large Language Models: A Systematic Review,"Large language models (LLMs) can assist in various health care activities, but current evaluation approaches may not adequately identify the most useful application areas. To summarize existing evaluations of LLMs in health care in terms of 5 components: (1) evaluation data type, (2) health care task, (3) natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, (4) dimension of evaluation, and (5) medical specialty. A systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science was performed for studies published between January 1, 2022, and February 19, 2024. Studies evaluating 1 or more LLMs in health care. Three independent reviewers categorized studies via keyword searches based on the data used, the health care tasks, the NLP and NLU tasks, the dimensions of evaluation, and the medical specialty. Of 519 studies reviewed, published between January 1, 2022, and February 19, 2024, only 5% used real patient care data for LLM evaluation. The most common health care tasks were assessing medical knowledge such as answering medical licensing examination questions (44.5%) and making diagnoses (19.5%). Administrative tasks such as assigning billing codes (0.2%) and writing prescriptions (0.2%) were less studied. For NLP and NLU tasks, most studies focused on question answering (84.2%), while tasks such as summarization (8.9%) and conversational dialogue (3.3%) were infrequent. Almost all studies (95.4%) used accuracy as the primary dimension of evaluation; fairness, bias, and toxicity (15.8%), deployment considerations (4.6%), and calibration and uncertainty (1.2%) were infrequently measured. Finally, in terms of medical specialty area, most studies were in generic health care applications (25.6%), internal medicine (16.4%), surgery (11.4%), and ophthalmology (6.9%), with nuclear medicine (0.6%), physical medicine (0.4%), and medical genetics (0.2%) being the least represented. Existing evaluations of LLMs mostly focus on accuracy of question answering for medical examinations, without consideration of real patient care data. Dimensions such as fairness, bias, and toxicity and deployment considerations received limited attention. Future evaluations should adopt standardized applications and metrics, use clinical data, and broaden focus to include a wider range of tasks and specialties",PubMed
Boosting GPT Models for Genomics Analysis: Generating Trusted Genetic Variant Annotations and Interpretations through RAG and fine-tuning,"Large language models (LLMs) have acquired a remarkable level of knowledge through their initial training. However, they lack expertise in particular domains such as genomics. Variant annotation data, an important component of genomics, is crucial for interpreting and prioritizing disease-related variants among millions of variants identified by genetic sequencing. In our project, we aimed to improve LLM performance in genomics by adding variant annotation data to LLMs by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and fine-tuning techniques. Using RAG, we successfully integrated 190 million highly accurate variant annotations, curated from 5 major annotation datasets and tools, into GPT-4o. This integration empowers users to query specific variants and receive accurate variant annotations and interpretations supported by advanced reasoning and language understanding capabilities of LLMs. Additionally, fine-tuning GPT-4 on variant annotation data also improved model performance in some annotation fields, although the accuracy across more fields remains suboptimal. Our model significantly improved the accessibility and efficiency of the variant interpretation process by leveraging LLM capabilities. Our project also revealed that RAG outperforms fine-tuning in factual knowledge injection in terms of data volume, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. As a pioneering study for adding genomics knowledge to LLMs, our work paves the way for developing more comprehensive and informative genomics AI systems to support clinical diagnosis and research projects, and it demonstrates the potential of LLMs in specialized domains",biorxiv
A Simplified Retriever to Improve Accuracy of Phenotype Normalizations by Large Language Models,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown improved accuracy in phenotype term normalization tasks when augmented with retrievers that suggest candidate normalizations based on term definitions. In this work, we introduce a simplified retriever that enhances LLM accuracy by searching the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) for candidate matches using contextual word embeddings from BioBERT without the need for explicit term definitions. Testing this method on terms derived from the clinical synopses of Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), we demonstrate that the normalization accuracy of a state-of-the-art LLM increases from a baseline of 62.3% without augmentation to 90.3% with retriever augmentation. This approach is potentially generalizable to other biomedical term normalization tasks and offers an efficient alternative to more complex retrieval methods",arXiv

Evaluation of the Diagnostic Accuracy of GPT-4 in Five Thousand Rare Disease Cases","Large language models (LLMs) show promise in supporting differential diagnosis, but their performance is challenging to evaluate due to the unstructured nature of their responses. To assess the current capabilities of LLMs to diagnose genetic diseases, we benchmarked these models on 5,213 case reports using the Phenopacket Schema, the Human Phenotype Ontology and Mondo disease ontology. Prompts generated from each phenopacket were sent to three generative pretrained transformer (GPT) models. The same phenopackets were used as input to a widely used diagnostic tool, Exomiser, in phenotype-only mode. The best LLM ranked the correct diagnosis first in 23.6% of cases, whereas Exomiser did so in 35.5% of cases. While the performance of LLMs for supporting differential diagnosis has been improving, it has not reached the level of commonly used traditional bioinformatics tools. Future research is needed to determine the best approach to incorporate LLMs into diagnostic pipelines","PubMed,medrxiv"
Unmasking and Quantifying Racial Bias of Large Language Models in Medical Report Generation,"Large language models like GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 hold promise for healthcare professionals, but they may inadvertently inherit biases during their training, potentially affecting their utility in medical applications. Despite few attempts in the past, the precise impact and extent of these biases remain uncertain. Through both qualitative and quantitative analyses, we find that these models tend to project higher costs and longer hospitalizations for White populations and exhibit optimistic views in challenging medical scenarios with much higher survival rates. These biases, which mirror real-world healthcare disparities, are evident in the generation of patient backgrounds, the association of specific diseases with certain races, and disparities in treatment recommendations, etc. Our findings underscore the critical need for future research to address and mitigate biases in language models, especially in critical healthcare applications, to ensure fair and accurate outcomes for all patients","PubMed,arXiv"

Analysis of large-language model versus human performance for genetics questions,"Large-language models like ChatGPT have recently received a great deal of attention. To assess ChatGPT in the field of genetics, we compared its performance to human respondents in answering genetics questions (involving 13,636 responses) that had been posted on social media platforms starting in 2021. Overall, ChatGPT did not perform significantly differently than human respondents, but did significantly better on memorization-type questions versus critical thinking questions, frequently provided different answers when asked questions multiple times, and provided plausible explanations for both correct and incorrect answers
==========
Large-language models like ChatGPT have recently received a great deal of attention. One area of interest pertains to how these models could be used in biomedical contexts, including related to human genetics. To assess one facet of this, we compared the performance of ChatGPT versus human respondents (13,642 human responses) in answering 85 multiple-choice questions about aspects of human genetics. Overall, ChatGPT did not perform significantly differently (p = 0.8327) than human respondents; ChatGPT was 68.2% accurate, compared to 66.6% accuracy for human respondents. Both ChatGPT and humans performed better on memorization-type questions versus critical thinking questions (p < 0.0001). When asked the same question multiple times, ChatGPT frequently provided different answers (16% of initial responses), including for both initially correct and incorrect answers, and gave plausible explanations for both correct and incorrect answers. ChatGPT's performance was impressive, but currently demonstrates significant shortcomings for clinical or other high-stakes use. Addressing these limitations will be important to guide adoption in real-life situations","PubMed,medrxiv"
ViTally Consistent: Scaling Biological Representation Learning for Cell Microscopy,"Large-scale cell microscopy screens are used in drug discovery and molecular biology research to study the effects of millions of chemical and genetic perturbations on cells. To use these images in downstream analysis, we need models that can map each image into a feature space that represents diverse biological phenotypes consistently, in the sense that perturbations with similar biological effects have similar representations. In this work, we present the largest foundation model for cell microscopy data to date, a new 1.9 billion-parameter ViT-G/8 MAE trained on over 8 billion microscopy image crops. Compared to a previous published ViT-L/8 MAE, our new model achieves a 60% improvement in linear separability of genetic perturbations and obtains the best overall performance on whole-genome biological relationship recall and replicate consistency benchmarks. Beyond scaling, we developed two key methods that improve performance: (1) training on a curated and diverse dataset; and, (2) using biologically motivated linear probing tasks to search across each transformer block for the best candidate representation of whole-genome screens. We find that many self-supervised vision transformers, pretrained on either natural or microscopy images, yield significantly more biologically meaningful representations of microscopy images in their intermediate blocks than in their typically used final blocks. More broadly, our approach and results provide insights toward a general strategy for successfully building foundation models for large-scale biological data",arXiv
Prevaccination Prevalence of Type-Specific Human Papillomavirus Infection by Grade of Cervical Cytology in Estonia,"Large-scale data on type-specific human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence and disease burden worldwide are needed to guide cervical cancer prevention efforts. Promoting the research and application of health care big data has become a key factor in modern medical research. To examine the prevaccination prevalence of high-risk HPV (hrHPV) and type distribution by cervical cytology grade in Estonia. This cross-sectional study used text mining and the linking of data from electronic health records and health care claims to examine type-specific hrHPV positivity in Estonia from 2012 to 2019. Participants were women aged at least 18 years. Statistical analysis was performed from September 2021 to August 2022. Type-specific hrHPV positivity rate by cervical cytological grade. A total of 11 017 cases of cervical cytology complemented with data on hrHPV testing results between 2012 and 2019 from 66 451 women aged at least 18 years (mean [SD] age, 48.1 [21.0] years) were included. The most common hrHPV types were HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 51 and 52, which accounted for 73.8% of all hrHPV types detected. There was a marked decline in the positivity rate of hrHPV infection with increasing age, but the proportion did not vary significantly based on HPV type. Implementation of nonavalent prophylactic vaccination was estimated to reduce the number of women with high-grade cytology by 50.5% (95% CI, 47.4%-53.6%) and the number with low-grade cytology by 27.8% (95% CI, 26.3%-29.3%), giving an overall estimated reduction of 33.1% (95% CI, 31.7%-34.5%) in the number of women with precancerous cervical cytology findings. In this cross-sectional study, text mining and natural language processing techniques allowed the detection of precursors to cervical cancer based on data stored by the nationwide health system. These findings contribute to the literature on type-specific HPV distribution by cervical cytology grade and document that α-9 phylogenetic group HPV types 16, 31, 33, 52 and α-7 phylogenetic group HPV 18 are the most frequently detected in normal-to-high-grade precancerous lesions in Estonia",PubMed
A Recurrent Mutation in Growth Hormone Receptor (GHR) Gene Underlying Laron-type Dwarfism in a Pakistani Family,"Laron syndrome (LS) is a rare autosomal recessively segregating disorder of severe short stature. The condition is characterized by short limbs, delayed puberty, hypoglycemia in infancy, and obesity. Mutations in growth hormone receptor (GHR) have been implicated in LS; hence, it is also known as growth hormone insensitivity syndrome (MIM-262500). Here we represent a consanguineous Pakistani family in which three siblings were afflicted with LS. Patients had rather similar phenotypic presentations marked with short stature, delayed bone age, limited extension of elbows, truncal obesity, delayed puberty, childish appearance, and frontal bossing. They also had additional features such as hypo-muscularity, early fatigue, large ears, widely-spaced breasts, and attention deficit behavior, which are rarely reported in LS. The unusual combination of the features hindered a straightforward diagnosis and prompted us to first detect the regions of shared homozygosity and subsequently the disease-causing variant by next generation technologies, like SNP genotyping and exome sequencing. A homozygous pathogenic variant c.508G>C (p.(Asp170His)) in GHR was detected. The variant is known to be implicated in LS, supporting the molecular diagnosis of LS. Also, we present detailed clinical, hematological, and hormonal profiling of the siblings",PubMed
"Etiology of Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease, Biomarker Efficacy, and the Role of Machine Learning in Stage Diagnosis","Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a subtype of dementia that manifests after the age of 65. It is characterized by progressive impairments in cognitive functions, behavioral changes, and learning difficulties. Given the progressive nature of the disease, early diagnosis is crucial. Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) is solely attributable to genetic factors, whereas LOAD has multiple contributing factors. A complex pathway mechanism involving multiple factors contributes to LOAD progression. Employing a systems biology approach, our analysis encompassed the genetic, epigenetic, metabolic, and environmental factors that modulate the molecular networks and pathways. These factors affect the brain's structural integrity, functional capacity, and connectivity, ultimately leading to the manifestation of the disease. This study has aggregated diverse biomarkers associated with factors capable of altering the molecular networks and pathways that influence brain structure, functionality, and connectivity. These biomarkers serve as potential early indicators for AD diagnosis and are designated as early biomarkers. The other biomarker datasets associated with the brain structure, functionality, connectivity, and related parameters of an individual are broadly categorized as clinical-stage biomarkers. This study has compiled research papers on Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis utilizing machine learning (ML) methodologies from both categories of biomarker data, including the applications of ML techniques for AD diagnosis. The broad objectives of our study are research gap identification, assessment of biomarker efficacy, and the most effective or prevalent ML technology used in AD diagnosis. This paper examines the predominant use of deep learning (DL) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis utilizing various types of biomarker data. Furthermore, this study has addressed the potential scope of using generative AI and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for data augmentation",PubMed
"Contact zone of slow worms Anguis fragilis Linnaeus, 1758 and Anguis colchica (Nordmann, 1840) in Poland","Legless lizards, the slow worms of the genus Anguis, are forming secondary contact zones within their Europe-wide distribution. We examined 35 populations of A. fragilis and A. colchica to identify the level of morphological and genetic divergence in Poland. We applied a conventional study approach using metric, meristic, and categorial (coloration) features for a phenotype analysis, and two standard molecular markers, a mitochondrial (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 2; ND2) and a nuclear (V(D)J recombination-activating protein 1; RAG1) one. We found clear differences between A. fragilis and A. colchica in molecular markers and phenotype-in meristic features, e.g., ear opening, number of scales rows around the body, and higher than so far known diversity in ND2 and RAG1 haplotypes. The presence of five hybrids was detected in three populations in the Polish part of the European contact zone. In all hybrids, homozygous alleles of RAG1 were detected, which suggests a back-crossing within the genus. The ability to produce fertile offspring by A. fragilis x A. colchica hybrids shows inefficient mechanisms of reproductive isolation of the two legless lizards. The hybrids were indistinguishable from parental species in head proportions (principal components and discriminant analyses) but more resembling A. colchica in meristic traits",PubMed
Whole Genome Transformer for Gene Interaction Effects in Microbiome Habitat Specificity,"Leveraging the vast genetic diversity within microbiomes offers unparalleled insights into complex phenotypes, yet the task of accurately predicting and understanding such traits from genomic data remains challenging. We propose a framework taking advantage of existing large models for gene vectorization to predict habitat specificity from entire microbial genome sequences. Based on our model, we develop attribution techniques to elucidate gene interaction effects that drive microbial adaptation to diverse environments. We train and validate our approach on a large dataset of high quality microbiome genomes from different habitats. We not only demonstrate solid predictive performance, but also how sequence-level information of entire genomes allows us to identify gene associations underlying complex phenotypes. Our attribution recovers known important interaction networks and proposes new candidates for experimental follow up",arXiv
A complex mechanism translating variation of a simple genetic architecture into alternative life-histories,"Linking genes to traits is a central goal in biology. Despite progress in discovering genes associated with trait differences, a poor understanding of the functional mechanisms underlying genetic associations leaves us critically far from connecting genetic and phenotypic variation. This knowledge-gap is particularly large in multifaceted phenotypes of ecological relevance such as life-history traits. Using a multiomic dissection of the genotype-phenotype association in a large-effect maturation age gene - the transcription cofactor vestigial-like 3 (vgll3) - in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), we show that vgll3 mediates concerted changes of distinct molecular phenotypes associated with puberty in male gonads. Vgll3 genotype conferring early maturity upregulates key genes controlling androgen production, cellular energy and adiposity, and TGF-{beta} signaling, among others, thereby increasing the likelihood of earlier pubertal initiation. Genotype-dependent developmental trajectories are produced through VGLL3 interaction with distinct transcription factors, thus coordinating differential activation of regulatory pathways. These results reveal a genetically simple, yet functionally complex, architecture underlying alternative life-histories where variation in a single major effect gene produces pleiotropic variation in a spectrum of cellular traits. Our results further suggest that evolution in correlated phenotypes such as exemplified by alternative life history strategies may be mediated by a surprisingly simple genetic architecture",biorxiv
Large-scale phenotypic and genomic characterization of Listeria monocytogenes susceptibility to quaternary ammonium compounds,"Listeria monocytogenes is a significant concern for the food industry due to its ability to persist in the food processing environment. Decreased susceptibility to disinfectants is one of the factors that contribute to the persistence of L. monocytogenes. The objective of this study was to explore the diversity of L. monocytogenes susceptibility to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) using 1,671 L. monocytogenes isolates. This was used to determine the phenotype-genotype concordance and characterize genomes of the QAC sensitive and tolerant isolates for stress resistance, virulence and plasmid replicon genes. Distribution of QAC tolerance genes among 37,897 publicly available L. monocytogenes genomes were also examined. The minimum inhibitory concentration to QACs was determined by the broth microdilution method and non-sequenced isolates (n=1,244) were whole genome sequenced. Genotype-phenotype concordance was 99% for benzalkonium chloride, DDAC and a commercial QAC based sanitizer. Prevalence of QAC tolerance genes was 23% and 28% in our L. monocytogenes collection and in the global dataset, respectively. qacH was the most prevalent gene in our collection (61%), with 19% prevalence in the global dataset. Notably, bcrABC was most common (72%) globally, while 25% in our collection. Prevalence of emrC and emrE was comparable in both datasets, 7% and 2%, respectively. Replicon genes, indicative of plasmid harborage, were detected in 44% of the isolates and associated with the QAC tolerant phenotype. The presented analysis is based on the biggest L. monocytogenes collection in diversity and quantity for characterization of the L. monocytogenes QAC tolerance at both phenotypic and genomic levels.  IMPORTANCEContamination of Listeria monocytogenes within the food processing environment is of concern to the food industry due to challenges in eradicating the pathogen once it becomes persistent in the environment. Genetic markers associated with increased tolerance to disinfectants have been identified, which alongside factors favor the persistence of L. monocytogenes in the production environment. By employing a comprehensive large-scale phenotypic testing and genomic analysis our study significantly enhances the understanding of the prevalence of quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) tolerant L. monocytogenes and the genetic determinants associated with the increased tolerance. Furthermore, we report on the prevalence of QAC tolerance genes among 37,897 publicly available L. monocytogenes sequences and their distribution within clonal complexes, isolation sources and geographical locations. As the propagation of QAC tolerance showed not be evenly distributed globally this highlights that understanding the development of L. monocytogenes disinfectant tolerance can be monitored using publicly available WGS data",biorxiv
Attitudes Toward Use of an APOL1 Genetic Testing Chatbot in Living Kidney Donor Evaluation: A Focus Group Study,"Living kidney donor (LKD) candidates of African ancestry are increasingly asked to undergo Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) genetic testing during the donor evaluation process to better understand their risk of kidney disease. LKD candidates' attitudes about using a clinical chatbot on APOL1 remain unknown. This study builds on prior work to culturally adapt the Gia (Genetic Information Assistant) chatbot on APOL1 by assessing donor, recipient, and community member attitudes about the Gia chatbot for enhancing the integration of APOL1 testing into the LKD clinical evaluation workflow. This study involved focus groups and a post-focus group survey in two US cities about the APOL1 Gia chatbot. Qualitative data were analyzed via thematic analysis, and descriptive statistics were used for demographic data. We conducted 10 focus groups including 54 participants (25 LKDs, 23 community members, and 6 living donor kidney transplant recipients of African ancestry). Five themes emerged: (1) participants supported LKD candidates using the Gia chatbot before the nephrologist clinic visit, (2) participants were interested in undergoing APOL1 testing after using Gia, (3) APOL1 testing costs may influence LKD candidates' willingness to get tested, (4) patients of African ancestry may hold varying preferences for using chatbots in the healthcare setting, and (5) individual-level barriers may limit the use of Gia in the healthcare setting. Individuals of African ancestry were highly receptive to integrating the APOL1 chatbot into LKD candidate clinical evaluation, which bodes well for integrating chatbots into the APOL1 clinical genetic testing process",PubMed
The ivory lncRNA regulates seasonal color patterns in buckeye butterflies,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcribed elements increasingly recognized for their roles in regulating gene expression. Thus far, however, we have little understanding of how lncRNAs contribute to evolution and adaptation. Here we show that a conserved lncRNA, ivory, is an important color patterning gene in the buckeye butterfly Junonia coenia. ivory overlaps with cortex, a locus linked to multiple cases of crypsis and mimicry in Lepidoptera. Along with a companion paper by Livraghi et. al., we argue that ivory, not cortex, is the color pattern gene of interest at this locus. In J. coenia a cluster of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in the first intron of ivory are genetically associated with natural variation in seasonal color pattern plasticity, and targeted deletions of these CREs phenocopy seasonal phenotypes. Deletions of different ivory CREs produce other distinct phenotypes as well, including loss of melanic eyespot rings, and positive and negative changes in overall wing pigmentation. We show that the color pattern transcription factors Spineless, Bric-a-brac, and Ftz-f1 bind to the ivory promoter during wing pattern development, suggesting that they directly regulate ivory. This case study demonstrates how cis-regulation of a single non-coding RNA can exert diverse and nuanced effects on the evolution and development of color patterns, including modulating seasonally plastic color patterns.  SignificanceThe genomic locus hosting the cortex gene has been linked to numerous cases of color pattern adaptation in moths and butterflies, including crypsis, mimicry, and seasonal polyphenism. Here we show in buckeye butterflies that the actual color pattern gene at the cortex locus is an evolutionarily conserved long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), dubbed ivory, that overlaps with cortex. Compared with other wing pattern genes, ivory stands out because of the highly nuanced, quantitative changes in pigmentation that can be achieved by manipulating adjacent cis-regulatory sequences. This study highlights how lncRNAs can be important factors underlying morphological evolution, and emphasizes the importance of considering non-coding transcripts in comparative genomics",biorxiv
Loss of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 function causes asparaginase resistance in T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia through decreased WNT pathway activity,"Loss-of-function mutations and deletions in core components of the epigenetic Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) are associated with poor prognosis and treatment resistance in T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We leveraged clinical mutational and transcriptional data to identify a functional link between PRC2 alterations and changes in WNT signaling pathway activity in leukemia cells. Computational integration of transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomic data from an isogenic T-ALL cellular model revealed reduced activity of the WNT-dependent stabilization of proteins (WNT/STOP) pathway in cells lacking core PRC2 factor EZH2. We discovered that PRC2 loss significantly reduced sensitivity to key T-ALL treatment asparaginase, and that this was mechanistically linked to increased cellular ubiquitination levels that bolstered leukemia cell asparagine reserves. We further found that asparaginase resistance in PRC2-depleted leukemic blasts could be mitigated by pharmaceutical proteasome inhibition, thereby providing a novel and clinically tractable means to tackle induction treatment failure in high-risk T-ALL",biorxiv
LumVertCancNet: A novel 3D lumbar vertebral body cancellous bone location and segmentation method based on hybrid Swin-transformer,"Lumbar vertebral body cancellous bone location and segmentation is crucial in an automated lumbar spine processing pipeline. Accurate and reliable analysis of lumbar spine image is expected to advantage practical medical diagnosis and population-based analysis of bone strength. However, the design of automated algorithms for lumbar spine processing is demanding due to significant anatomical variations and scarcity of publicly available data. In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) and vision transformers (Vits) have been the de facto standard in medical image segmentation. Although adept at capturing global features, the inherent bias of locality and weight sharing of CNN constrains its capacity to model long-range dependency. In contrast, Vits excel at long-range dependency modeling, but they may not generalize well with limited datasets due to the lack of inductive biases inherent to CNN. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based two-stage coarse-to-fine solution to address the problem of automatic location and segmentation of lumbar vertebral body cancellous bone. Specifically, in the first stage, a Swin-transformer based model is applied to predict the heatmap of lumbar vertebral body centroids. Considering the characteristic anatomical structure of lumbar spine, we propose a novel loss function called LumAnatomy loss, which enforces the order and bend of the predicted vertebral body centroids. To inherit the excellence of CNN and Vits while preventing their respective limitations, in the second stage, we propose an encoder-decoder network to segment the identified lumbar vertebral body cancellous bone, which consists of two parallel encoders, i.e., a Swin-transformer encoder and a CNN encoder. To enhance the combination of CNNs and Vits, we propose a novel multi-scale attention feature fusion module (MSA-FFM), which address issues that arise when fusing features given at different encoders. To tackle the issue of lack of data, we raise the first large-scale lumbar vertebral body cancellous bone segmentation dataset called LumVBCanSeg containing a total of 185 CT scans annotated at voxel level by 3 physicians. Extensive experimental results on the LumVBCanSeg dataset demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperform other state-of-the-art medical image segmentation methods. The data is publicly available at: https://zenodo.org/record/8181250. The implementation of the proposed method is available at: https://github.com/sia405yd/LumVertCancNet",PubMed
Enhancing patient representation learning with inferred family pedigrees improves disease risk prediction,"Machine learning and deep learning are powerful tools for analyzing electronic health records (EHRs) in healthcare research. Although family health history has been recognized as a major predictor for a wide spectrum of diseases, research has so far adopted a limited view of family relations, essentially treating patients as independent samples in the analysis. To address this gap, we present ALIGATEHR, which models inferred family relations in a graph attention network augmented with an attention-based medical ontology representation, thus accounting for the complex influence of genetics, shared environmental exposures, and disease dependencies. Taking disease risk prediction as a use case, we demonstrate that explicitly modeling family relations significantly improves predictions across the disease spectrum. We then show how ALIGATEHR's attention mechanism, which links patients' disease risk to their relatives' clinical profiles, successfully captures genetic aspects of diseases using longitudinal EHR diagnosis data. Finally, we use ALIGATEHR to successfully distinguish the 2 main inflammatory bowel disease subtypes with highly shared risk factors and symptoms (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). Overall, our results highlight that family relations should not be overlooked in EHR research and illustrate ALIGATEHR's great potential for enhancing patient representation learning for predictive and interpretable modeling of EHRs",PubMed
Genetic factors associated with reasons for clinical trial stoppage,"Many drug discovery projects are started but few progress fully through clinical trials to approval. Previous work has shown that human genetics support for the therapeutic hypothesis increases the chance of trial progression. Here, we applied natural language processing to classify the free-text reasons for 28,561 clinical trials that stopped before their endpoints were met. We then evaluated these classes in light of the underlying evidence for the therapeutic hypothesis and target properties. We found that trials are more likely to stop because of a lack of efficacy in the absence of strong genetic evidence from human populations or genetically modified animal models. Furthermore, certain trials are more likely to stop for safety reasons if the drug target gene is highly constrained in human populations and if the gene is broadly expressed across tissues. These results support the growing use of human genetics to evaluate targets for drug discovery programs",PubMed

Digital ECMT Cancer Trial Matching Tool: an Open Source Research Application to Support Oncologists in the Identification of Precision Medicine Clinical Trials,"Matching patients with cancer to precision medicine clinical trials on the basis of their tumor genotype has the potential to improve outcomes for patients who have exhausted standard-of-care treatment options. However, the matching process presents a substantial challenge because of the number of clinical trials available. We describe a free, open source research tool designed to extract relevant trial information to support oncologists in the matching process, and we illustrate its utility with recent case studies of patients who were matched to trials using this tool. Trial records are sourced from ClinicalTrials.gov and indexed using natural language processing techniques, including named entity recognition, term normalization, and relationship extraction. Relationships between trials and genetic alterations are assigned scores on the basis of a rule-based system. All data are updated daily. A user interface is provided via R Shiny app. An instance of the trial match tool, configured for UK clinical trials, is hosted by the digital Experimental Cancer Medicine Team (see link in Data Sharing Statement). Users select the relevant cancer type and genetic alteration(s). Matching studies are ranked according to the score assigned for the selected genetic alterations. Results may be downloaded and attached to the patient's health record if desired. The tool is currently being used to support the ongoing TARGET National study, which aims to match up to 6,000 patients to early phase clinical trials. We present three case studies that exemplify relationships between genetic alterations and studies. With increasing numbers of precision medicine treatments and as comprehensive molecular profiling of tumor samples becomes more common, decision support tools are likely to become increasingly important. This work represents an important step toward the development and wider implementation of such systems",PubMed
Generating 3D Brain Tumor Regions in MRI using Vector-Quantization Generative Adversarial Networks,"Medical image analysis has significantly benefited from advancements in deep learning, particularly in the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating realistic and diverse images that can augment training datasets. However, the effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the amount of available data in clinical settings. Additionally, the common GAN-based approach is to generate entire image volumes, rather than solely the region of interest (ROI). Research on deep learning-based brain tumor classification using MRI has shown that it is easier to classify the tumor ROIs compared to the entire image volumes. In this work, we present a novel framework that uses vector-quantization GAN and a transformer incorporating masked token modeling to generate high-resolution and diverse 3D brain tumor ROIs that can be directly used as augmented data for the classification of brain tumor ROI. We apply our method to two imbalanced datasets where we augment the minority class: (1) the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) 2019 dataset to generate new low-grade glioma (LGG) ROIs to balance with high-grade glioma (HGG) class; (2) the internal pediatric LGG (pLGG) dataset tumor ROIs with BRAF V600E Mutation genetic marker to balance with BRAF Fusion genetic marker class. We show that the proposed method outperforms various baseline models in both qualitative and quantitative measurements. The generated data was used to balance the data in the brain tumor types classification task. Using the augmented data, our approach surpasses baseline models by 6.4% in AUC on the BraTS 2019 dataset and 4.3% in AUC on our internal pLGG dataset. The results indicate the generated tumor ROIs can effectively address the imbalanced data problem. Our proposed method has the potential to facilitate an accurate diagnosis of rare brain tumors using MRI scans",arXiv

Integration of natural and deep artificial cognitive models in medical images: BERT-based NER and relation extraction for electronic medical records,"Medical images and signals are important data sources in the medical field, and they contain key information such as patients' physiology, pathology, and genetics. However, due to the complexity and diversity of medical images and signals, resulting in difficulties in medical knowledge acquisition and decision support. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes an end-to-end framework based on BERT for NER and RE tasks in electronic medical records. Our framework first integrates NER and RE tasks into a unified model, adopting an end-to-end processing manner, which removes the limitation and error propagation of multiple independent steps in traditional methods. Second, by pre-training and fine-tuning the BERT model on large-scale electronic medical record data, we enable the model to obtain rich semantic representation capabilities that adapt to the needs of medical fields and tasks. Finally, through multi-task learning, we enable the model to make full use of the correlation and complementarity between NER and RE tasks, and improve the generalization ability and effect of the model on different data sets. We conduct experimental evaluation on four electronic medical record datasets, and the model significantly out performs other methods on different datasets in the NER task. In the RE task, the EMLB model also achieved advantages on different data sets, especially in the multi-task learning mode, its performance has been significantly improved, and the ETE and MTL modules performed well in terms of comprehensive precision and recall. Our research provides an innovative solution for medical image and signal data",PubMed
MedLexSp - a medical lexicon for Spanish medical natural language processing,"Medical lexicons enable the natural language processing (NLP) of health texts. Lexicons gather terms and concepts from thesauri and ontologies, and linguistic data for part-of-speech (PoS) tagging, lemmatization or natural language generation. To date, there is no such type of resource for Spanish. This article describes an unified medical lexicon for Medical Natural Language Processing in Spanish. MedLexSp includes terms and inflected word forms with PoS information and Unified Medical Language System[Formula: see text] (UMLS) semantic types, groups and Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs). To create it, we used NLP techniques and domain corpora (e.g. MedlinePlus). We also collected terms from the Dictionary of Medical Terms from the Spanish Royal Academy of Medicine, the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT), the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Terminology (MedDRA), the International Classification of Diseases vs. 10, the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Dictionary, the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and OrphaData. Terms related to COVID-19 were assembled by applying a similarity-based approach with word embeddings trained on a large corpus. MedLexSp includes 100 887 lemmas, 302 543 inflected forms (conjugated verbs, and number/gender variants), and 42 958 UMLS CUIs. We report two use cases of MedLexSp. First, applying the lexicon to pre-annotate a corpus of 1200 texts related to clinical trials. Second, PoS tagging and lemmatizing texts about clinical cases. MedLexSp improved the scores for PoS tagging and lemmatization compared to the default Spacy and Stanza python libraries. The lexicon is distributed in a delimiter-separated value file; an XML file with the Lexical Markup Framework; a lemmatizer module for the Spacy and Stanza libraries; and complementary Lexical Record (LR) files.

MGI: Multimodal Contrastive pre-training of Genomic and Medical Imaging,"Medicine is inherently a multimodal discipline. Medical images can reflect the pathological changes of cancer and tumors, while the expression of specific genes can influence their morphological characteristics. However, most deep learning models employed for these medical tasks are unimodal, making predictions using either image data or genomic data exclusively. In this paper, we propose a multimodal pre-training framework that jointly incorporates genomics and medical images for downstream tasks. To address the issues of high computational complexity and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies in genes sequence modeling with MLP or Transformer architectures, we utilize Mamba to model these long genomic sequences. We aligns medical images and genes using a self-supervised contrastive learning approach which combines the Mamba as a genetic encoder and the Vision Transformer (ViT) as a medical image encoder. We pre-trained on the TCGA dataset using paired gene expression data and imaging data, and fine-tuned it for downstream tumor segmentation tasks. The results show that our model outperformed a wide range of related methods",arXiv
Metabolic syndrome in New Zealand Obese mice promotes microglial-vascular interactions and reduces microglial plasticity,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) puts patients more at risk for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease (AD). Microglia are implicated as causal factors in AD, however, the effect of MetS on microglia has not been characterized. To address this, we contrasted New Zealand Obese (NZO) with C57BL/6J (B6J) mice in combination with a high fat/high sugar diet (HFD). Irrespective of diet, NZO mice displayed a broader array of MetS-relevant phenotypes compared to B6J mice fed a HFD. Single cell RNA-sequencing of microglia predicted transcriptional shifts indicative of reduced responsiveness and increased vascular interactions in NZO, but not B6J HFD mice. Significant cerebrovascular fibrin deposition and increased perivascular accumulation of microglia were observed in NZO relative to B6J HFD mice. Further, compared to the widely used B6J.APP/PS1 mice, NZO.APP/PS1 exhibited increased amyloid plaque sizes alongside an increase in microhemorrhages. Overall, our work supports a model whereby MetS alters microglia-vascular interactions, compromising microglial plasticity.  IntroductionMetabolic syndrome (MetS) is a combination of three or more metabolic impairments such as dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and increased waist circumference (1). Patients displaying aspects of MetS are more at risk for neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimers disease (AD) (2-6). Central to this risk may be the influence of MetS and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) on peripheral and central immune cell states and function (7,8).  Burgeoning evidence has implicated critical roles for microglia, central nervous system (CNS) resident macrophages, in neurodegeneration (9-15). Microglia play roles in pathogen surveillance, debris phagocytosis, synapse regulation, and recently have been shown to support the cerebral vasculature (16-21). Current efforts have uncovered remarkable heterogeneity of microglial responses through single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) (9,11,15,22). Increased disease-associated microglia (DAM) (11,12) and interferon response microglia (IRM) states (23) have been documented in neurodegeneration. The abundance of these states is heavily dependent on additional factors including age, sex, and genetic context (15,22-25). However, the effect of MetS on microglial states has yet to be determined.  To address this, we investigated MetS-induced changes in microglial transcriptional states using scRNA-seq. We utilized combinations of genetic and environmental models relevant to MetS contrasting New Zealand Obese (NZO/HlLtJ) mice, a polygenic model of obesity (26-28), with the commonly used C57BL/6J (B6J) mice fed a high fat/high sugar diet (HFD). Microglia scRNA-seq suggested MetS resulted in reduced microglial responsiveness in NZO mice relating to vascular interactions and function. In support of this, NZO but not B6J mice exhibited fibrin deposition within the cerebrovasculature. NZO mice also showed reduced microglia responses to an acute lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge compared to B6J mice, and larger amyloid-{beta} plaques and increased microhemorrhages in the presence of APP/PS1 transgenes (NZO.APP/PS1) compared to B6J.APP/PS1 mice. In summary, MetS appeared to impair microglial plasticity, which could potentially drive neurodegenerative disease pathology.  ResultsO_ST_ABSMetabolic syndrome (MetS) caused subtle changes in abundances of microglia states.C_ST_ABSTo determine how MetS affects microglia, we fed NZO and B6J mice a HFD or a standard diet (SD) from 2-9 months of age (mo). NZO mice showed signs of MetS at 2mo (Figure 1A-E). At 9mo, NZO mice displayed increased age-and diet-associated metabolic impairments relative to B6J mice, including weight gain, dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, and hyperglycemia (Figure 1F-J). These data indicate that the NZO strain better models complex endophenotypes observed in humans with MetS compared to HFD-fed B6J mice.

All data shown are Mean{+/-}SEM.  C_FIG  To determine the effects of strain (NZO, B6J) and diet (SD, HFD) on myeloid cell transcriptional states, we performed scRNA-seq of CD11B+ cells (24,29) from brains of 2 and 9mo male and female B6J, B6J HFD, NZO, and NZO HFD mice (Figure 2A). Microglia represented [~]75% of all captured CD11B+ cells in B6J mice, and [~]88% in NZO mice, irrespective of diet (Figure S1A-D) (30,31). The remaining cells consisted mainly of monocytes, macrophages, NK cells, and neutrophils (Figure S1D). Re-clustering only microglia resulted in 18 clusters (Figure S1E-F) with further annotation as: homeostatic (H, clusters: 0-6,9, 13,14, and 16), proliferating (cluster 17), Hexb high (HexB, cluster 10), disease-associated (DAM, cluster 8), Ccl4 Ccl3 high DAM (Ccl4+ Ccl3+ DAM, cluster 7), major histocompatibility enriched (MHC, cluster 16), interferon responsive microglia (IRM, cluster 12) and Klf2 Tcim high (Klf2+ Tcim+, cluster 13) (Figure 2B-D, Figure S1E-F) (11,12,22,24). In contrast to amyloid-(11,12,24) and aging-related (22) studies, MetS (NZO strain and/or HFD) did not cause significant changes in the percentages of DAM, IRM or MHC clusters (Figures 2E, S2A). However, the abundance of DAM, MHC, and Klf2+ microglia changed with age, regardless of strain or diet (Figure 2E, Figure S2A-B).

C_FIG  High fat diet altered stress response and cell-cell communication gene expression in NZO, but not B6J microgliaDespite the lack of MetS-induced shifts in microglial states (Figure 2E), we reasoned that MetS may alter gene expression across all microglia. To determine this, we utilized a pseudobulking strategy followed by differential expression analyses, separately assessing the strain (NZOvB6J), and diet (HFDvSD) or aging (9v2mo) effect within each strain (Figure S3A-B)(32,33). First, we determined the HFD effect across both NZO and B6J mice and found that there were 141 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in all microglia, which were enriched in gene sets associated with cell viability, migration, and proliferation (Figures 3A, S4A-C). However, when HFD effects were analyzed separately for each strain, B6J microglia did not show a substantial response to chronic HFD exhibiting only 2 DEGs in comparison with >300 DEGs in NZO microglia (Figure 3A,S4D). These NZO DEGs were associated with endothelial and immune cell signaling, and heat shock stress (Figure 3B-D). Together, these data suggest HFD caused a significant stress response in microglia in NZO, but not B6J mice.

C_FIG  Aging differentially effected NZO and B6J microgliaTo assess transcriptional programs in NZO compared to B6J, we first identified DEGs comparing NZO to B6J microglia at 2 or 9mo. DEGs identified at both ages included genes that have been implicated in regulating microglial and macrophage responses, such as Angptl7, Itgam, and Fcrls (Figure 4A-B,S5A-D) (22,34-36). Interestingly, Apoe, genetic variations in APOE increase risk for AD (37,38), was significantly greater in NZO compared to B6J microglia at both ages (Figure 4C). At 9mo, DEGs were associated with immune responses, vascular interactions, and cell migration (Figure 4D-E), suggesting these processes are perturbed in NZO but not B6 microglia. When microglia states were analyzed separately, differentially expressed genes detected in all microglia were primarily driven by homeostatic microglia, downsampling indicated this was independent of the number of microglia within each state (Figure S5A-B).

C_FIG  Next, to better understand how transcriptional programs were influenced by aging, we compared 9 to 2mo microglia from either NZO or B6J mice (Figure 4F). Most aging related transcriptional changes were again detected within the homeostatic microglia state when analyzed separately (Figure S6A-B). Both strains showed aging-associated changes in Itga6, Ctss, Cd48, and antigen processing and presentation pathways (Figure 4F-I). However, NZO microglia exhibited more aging-associated DEGs than B6J including Sparc, Pfkfb3, and Irf8; which have been implicated in regulating synaptic function, glycolysis, and microglial identity respectively (Figure 4F- G) (39-41). In addition, NZO microglia exhibited age-dependent changes in cytotoxicity, wound healing, and circulation pathways (Figure 4I). Interestingly, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of upstream regulators predicted aging-associated upregulation of interferon signaling regulators in B6J microglia, but regulators associated with environmental stress and tissue repair in NZO microglia (Figure S6C-E).  NZO microglia displayed increased association with blood vesselsThe expression of genes regulating myeloid-endothelial interactions including Itgam, Ccr1, P2ry12, and Ccr5 (16,35,36,42), was higher in NZO relative to B6J microglia (Figure 4). To probe this further, we performed immunohistochemistry to localize microglia and vasculature within the cortex and hippocampus of 9mo NZO and B6J mice fed SD or HFD. We found that while the numbers of TMEM119+DAPI+ microglia in the hippocampus or cortex did not differ across strains or diets, the percentage of CD31+ area covered by microglia was significantly higher in NZO relative to B6J mice (Figure 5A-E). HFD did not modulate this phenomenon (Figure 5B-E). scRNA-seq analyses predicted fibrin(ogen) to be an upstream regulator of aging-associated DEGs in NZO microglia (Figure 5F). Fibrin is absent in the healthy CNS but can deposit in the perivascular space and within vessels in conditions of stress (38,43,44). We found NZO vessels exhibited peri-vascular and vascular deposition of fibrin in the hippocampus and cortex, while B6J vessels did not (Figure 5G-I). Furthermore, many of these fibrin+ vessels had microglia juxtaposed (Figure 5G). Altogether, these data suggest that vessel stress signals may promote microglia-vascular interactions in NZO mice.

C_FIG  NZO mice displayed a dampened response to LPSAs NZO microglia appeared to have a reduction in DEGs relevant to immune responses compared to B6J microglia (Figure 4,S5), we sought to probe the responsiveness of NZO microglia to an acute inflammatory challenge. LPS was administered to 4mo NZO and B6J mice, and bulk hemibrain RNA-seq (Figure 6A) was performed. As we suspected from the observed fibrin deposition, NZO animals exhibited altered CNS expression of vascular associated pathways and genes including Edn1, Angpt1, and Serpine1 (Figure 6B-C) even with PBS-treatment. LPS-treated NZO animals also displayed fewer DEGs than LPS-treated B6J mice (Figure 6D). The strain-dependent LPS effects suggested potential differences in microglial responses, as NZO animals displayed no change in Cx3cr1 expression with LPS treatment (Figure 6E). Furthermore, IPA upstream regulator and pathway analyses predicted strain-dependent differences in the LPS induction of genes involving macrophage recruitment, antigen processing and presentation, and aggregation of cells (Figure 6F). These data indicate that compared to B6J, NZO mice display altered microglial responses to not only HFD, but also to an acute insult such as LPS.

C_FIG  NZO.APP/PS1 mice displayed larger amyloid plaques and increased incidences of microhemorrhagesMetS has been demonstrated to increase risk for AD and related dementias (2,4,5,45). We hypothesized that this may be due to reduced responsiveness of microglia to AD-relevant insults such as amyloid deposition. To test this, we backcrossed the commonly used amyloid-inducing transgenes (APP/PS1) (46) from B6J to NZO resulting in [~]98.375% congenicity. Unexpectedly, male NZO.APP/PS1 mice exhibited pronounced weight loss, likely associated with exacerbation of T2D (Figure S7A-E). To avoid this confound, we primarily focused our analyses on amyloid-related microglia responses in female mice. At 8mo, in comparison to B6J.APP/PS1 mice, female NZO.APP/PS1 mice exhibited fewer, but larger, amyloid plaques in both the hippocampus and cortex, which were positive for the dystrophic neurite marker LAMP1 (Figure 7A-L). Similar results were observed in several male NZO.APP/PS1 mice that survived to 8mo (Figure S7F-G). There was a small but significant increase in total IBA1+ area in the hippocampus, but not the cortex of NZO.APP/PS1 compared to B6J.APP/PS1 mice (Figure 7F,K). However, the area of plaque covered by microglia were the same in both regions (Figure 7G, L).

Two-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukeys test. Data are presented as Mean{+/-}SEM.  C_FIG  Previous studies have shown microglia depletion drives development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (14,47). We wondered whether the reduced responsiveness of NZO microglia would result in increased CAA. However, extensive CAA was not present in NZO.APP/PS1 or B6J.APP/PS1 mice (Figure 7A, S7F-G). Our previous findings of increased vascular stress in NZO (Figures 5-6) suggested blood-brain-barrier integrity may be more compromised in NZO.APP/PS1 compared to B6J.APP/PS1 mice. To assess this, we stained brain tissue with Prussian blue, which marks areas of iron deposition, and found that NZO.APP/PS1 mice displayed increased incidence of microhemorrhages throughout the brain relative to either B6J.APP/PS1 mice or their WT littermate controls (Figure 7M-N).  Together, these data support that in a context of MetS, amyloid plaques are larger and the cerebrovasculature is more prone to microhemorrhages, outcomes which may increase risk for diseases such as AD.  DiscussionOur work focused on the relationship between MetS and alterations in microglial responses using mice exhibiting varying aspects of MetS (26-28). Consistent with previous reports, NZO mice displayed most aspects of MetS, and this was exacerbated with HFD. However, HFD-fed B6J mice exhibited dysfunctional metabolic measures associated only with pre-diabetes and obesity, identifying NZO mice as a more appropriate model of MetS than B6J HFD mice. We profiled 83,757 microglia and unexpectedly, MetS did not significantly shift the proportion of previously identified microglial states (11,12,22,24). We noted an increase in MHC and Klf2+ transcriptional states and a decrease in both DAM populations between 2 and 9mo. This is consistent with previous reports of age-related alterations in MHC and DAM microglia populations (48).  We identified significant strain-specific changes in gene expression programs across all microglia, and within specific states. Strikingly, when we analyzed differential expression within each state, cells within the homeostatic clusters exhibited the greatest number of DEGs even after downsampling. This suggests that these transcriptional changes, while not sufficient to alter state abundances, are potentially altering microglial function. Strain-specific differences in microglia are likely driven by the MetS endophenotypes exhibited by NZO as early as 2mo. NZO microglia exhibited significantly higher expression of Apoe compared to B6J or B6J HFD microglia. ApoE has been linked to the transition to a DAM (or activated response microglia) state (12,23), yet, there was no difference in the abundance of DAM between NZO and B6J mice. One explanation for this paradox may be that the increase in Apoe expression is in response to dyslipidemia, as ApoE has known roles in lipid metabolism (37,49,50). Furthermore, it is possible that NZO microglia are unable to fully transition to a DAM state yet still acquire DAM-like characteristics such as high Apoe expression. In addition to the aging-and HFD-independent strain differences, there were also significant aging-and HFD-dependent strain differences between NZO and B6J microglia. For instance, aging influenced NZO microglia more than B6J microglia through higher numbers of DEGs and a broader range of impacted pathways, including wound healing and cytotoxicity. One recent study suggested that NZO mice display enhanced aging-associated changes within peripheral immune populations --suggesting that NZO were a model of accelerated aging (51) -- and our data also support this possibility.  A prevailing signature of both aging-and strain-associated analyses implicated microglia differential interactions with the vasculature. Further exploration through IHC highlighted that regardless of diet, NZO mice exhibited more perivascular microglia than B6J mice. Upstream regulator analysis predicted fibrin may a significant culprit behind aging-associated changes in NZO microglia and fibrin deposition was detected in NZO brains. Fibrin has previously been shown to be neurotoxic (35,36). Fibrin upregulates Hmox1 expression in microglia (36) and upstream regulator analysis predicted activation of HMOX1-dependent inflammatory response signaling pathways when comparing 9mo NZO and B6J microglia. Furthermore, MetS has been associated with increased CCL5, which can recruit immune cells via CCR1/CCR5 to vasculature (52-54). NZO mice exhibit peripheral vascular stress (55), and NZO microglia display higher expression of Ccr1 and Ccr5.  Collectively, these data predict MetS may increase vascular stress and fibrin deposition in the CNS, resulting in recruitment of microglia to the cerebrovasculature. This primary endophenotype may than render microglia less responsive to a secondary insult. To test this, we first used an acute LPS treatment and performed bulk RNA-seq on hemibrains. We found increased expression of vascular associated genes in NZO hemibrains relative to B6J hemibrains including Serpine1, Edn1 and Angpt1 which mediate vascular stress and fibrin accumulation (56-58). Further, fewer DEGs were identified in LPS-treated NZO mice compared to LPS-treated B6J. This provides support for decreased responsiveness in NZO microglia. For example, Cx3cr1 did not change in LPS-treated NZO mice. Cx3cr1 expression has been shown to decrease in neurodegeneration (11,12). Interestingly, recently published data suggest aged microglia display a dampened response to LPS, supporting the concept that NZO mice may be a model of MetS-dependent accelerated aging (59).  Following acute stimuli, we turned to a more chronic and disease-relevant inflammatory stimulus, amyloid deposition (12,14,23,60). We found that NZO.APP/PS1 mice displayed a significant increase in plaque size, independent of numbers of plaque-associated microglia. Increased plaque sizes may impact larger regions leading to increased likelihood of cognitive dysfunction. Patients displaying MetS have accelerated plaque deposition, and MetS blood biomarkers correlate with the rate of cognitive decline in patients with MCI and dementia (61,62). One possibility for the increased plaque size is in NZO.APP/PS1 compared to B6J.APP/PS1 mice is inefficient plaque compaction or clearance by NZO microglia - that would fit with the model of MetS-dependent reduced responsiveness. A second possibility may be altered activity of insulin degrading enzyme (IDE). In addition to insulin degradation, IDE also contributes to plaque degradation (63). Microglia-specific or brain-wide Ide expression was not changed between NZO and B6J mice, however, a MetS-dependent increase in insulin, requiring degrading by IDE in NZO mice, may result in reduced amyloid-{beta} degradation.  Emerging work has implicated microglia in regulating blood flow and closure of injured vascular barriers (16,18,64). Therefore, given the vascular stress and changes to microglia-vascular interactions in NZO mice, we investigated whether NZO.APP/PS1 mice were susceptible to microhemorrhages. NZO.APP/PS1 mice presented with microhemorrhages, which were rare in B6J.APP/PS1 mice or WT littermate controls. Microhemorrhages are more common in AD patients than in control groups and were previously detected in Ob/Ob APP/PS1 mice (65-68). One possible mechanism driving the microhemorrhages in NZO.APP/PS1 mice relates to fibrin deposition. Fibrin is stabilized by amyloid-{beta} potentiating vascular damage and blood-brain-barrier breakdown (38,69). Recent evidence suggests the amount of fibrin coverage of vessels correlates to cerebral microbleeds in patients with CAA (70). Yet, we did not observe extensive CAA in NZO.APP/PS1 mice. It is possible microhemorrhages in NZO.APP/PS1 mice are a result of the inability of microglia to clear fibrin and/or amyloid-{beta} efficiently, alongside potential impairments in wound healing and vascular repair pathways may predispose NZO mice to increased microhemorrhages. Diabetes worsens wound healing and vascular repair pathways in a variety of pathological conditions (71) and NZO microglia exhibit age-associated alterations in wound healing pathways underscoring this possibility. These data provide further evidence that MetS reduces or dampens the responsiveness of microglia.  In summary, we have found that MetS in NZO mice fundamentally altered microglia responses even when compared to microglia of HFD-fed B6J mice. NZO microglia displayed age-associated transcriptional changes concomitant with increased perivascular association. These changes were associated with abnormal responses to an acute LPS challenge and chronic amyloid pathology altogether suggesting MetS reduced microglial plasticity. Overall, this also supported the hypothesis of accelerated aging in NZO compared to B6J. This work provides the foundation to investigate the mechanisms by which MetS compromises microglial responses, leading to increased risk for neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimers disease",biorxiv
"Genes in Humans and Mice: Insights from Deep learning of 777K Bulk Transcriptomes
==========
Deep Learning on 777K Bulk Transcriptomes Unveils Human-Mouse Cross-Species Gene Disparities","Mice are widely used as animal models in biomedical research, favored for their small size, ease of breeding, and anatomical and physiological similarities to humans1,2. However, discrepancies between mouse gene experimental results and the actual behavior of human genes are not uncommon, despite their shared DNA sequence similarity3-8. This suggests that DNA sequence similarity does not always reliably predict functional similarity. On the other hand, RNA-level gene expression could offer additional information about gene function9,10. In this study, we undertook characterization and inter-species comparison of human and mouse genes by applying innovative deep learning methodologies to a large dataset of 410K human and 366K mouse bulk RNA-seq samples. This was achieved by using gene representations from our Transformer-based GeneRAIN model11,12. These gene representations aggregate information from large gene expression datasets, and provide insights beyond DNA sequence similarity. We identified 2,407 human-mouse homologous genes with high DNA similarity but distinct RNA characteristics, and showed that these genes are more likely to have differing disease/phenotype associations between the two species. Additionally, we found 3,070 homologous genes with low similarity at both the DNA and RNA levels, suggesting the highest risk of discrepancies in study results between the two species. We propose that this approach will support future decision making around whether the mouse will be an appropriate model for studying specific human genes, and whether the results of specific mouse gene studies are likely to be recapitulated in humans. Our methodological innovations offer valuable lessons for future deep learning applications in cross-species omics data. The interspecies gene relationship findings from our study also contribute valuable insights into the gene biology and evolution of the two species",biorxiv
Expression Patterns of Mal genes and its Association with Differential Maltose and Maltotriose Transport rate of Two Saccharomyces pastorianus Yeasts,"Microorganisms play a significant role in fermented food biotechnology by converting raw materials in human edible organoleptic and nutritive components, especially in the beer brewing industry. The lager-style beer is the dominant industrial beer type, and it is fermented by Saccharomyces pastorianus (Sp) whose members encompass two groups. Typically, strains belonging to group I are deficient in maltotriose consumption. The main variables linked to this phenotype are fermentation conditions, the presence of maltotriose transporters, copy number variation of maltose and maltotriose transporters, and differential genetic regulation. This study was aimed to determine that the differences the alpha-glycoside consumption phenotypes of two Sp strains, Sp820 and Sp790, are related with different phylogenetic distribution and gene expression of the transporters ScMalx1, SeMalx1, ScAGT1, SeAGT1, MTT1 and MPHx. Biochemical analyses of the transport rate confirmed that the Sp790 strain transported more maltose and maltotriose, 28% and 32% respectively, than Sp820 strain. In addition, detection of Sp790 transcripts indicated the presence of all the Mal genes analyzed since the first day of fermentation, whereas Sp820 only presented transcripts for the ScMalx1, ScAGT1, and MPHx genes. These results indicate that a multifactorial phenomenon related with phylogenetic distribution, polymorphisms in transmembrane domains and the difference in the genetic expression of maltose and maltotriose transporters are involved in the phenotypic diversity related with maltose and maltotriose consumption in two lager yeast.  IMPORTANCEBeer is the third most popular beverage around the world and has roughly 90% market share in the alcoholic beverage industry. Saccharomyces pastorianus (Sp) strains, which are widely used for lager beer production, have a phenotypic diversity involved in maltotriosa consumption. The fermentation of this sugar is fundamental for the flavor landscape produced during lager beer brewing. This phenotypic diversity encompasses lager yeast strain with remarkable ability to consume maltotriose; Sp group II, to poor capacity of consumption for some lager yeast belonging to Sp group I. Research in this field indicate that variables like conditions of fermentation, presence of maltotriose transporter specific genes, and differential gene regulation can cause this diversity. The significance of our study is to approximate and also contribute to the elucidation of mechanistic variables involved in such phenotypic variability that will allow the development of more controlled and efficient biotechnological processes around beer brewing industry",biorxiv
Genetic analysis of milk citrate predicted by milk mid-infrared spectra of Holstein cows in early lactation,"Milk citrate is regarded as an early biomarker of negative energy balance in dairy cows during early lactation and serves as a suitable candidate phenotype for genomic selection due to its wide availability across a large number of cows through milk mid-infrared spectra prediction. However, its genetic background is not well known. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to (1) analyze the genetic parameters of milk citrate; (2) identify genomic regions associated with milk citrate; and (3) analyze the functional annotation of candidate genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to milk citrate in Walloon Holstein cows. In total, 134,517 test-day milk-citrate phenotypes (mmol/L) collected within the first 50 d in milk on 52,198 Holstein cows were used. These milk-citrate phenotypes, predicted by milk mid-infrared spectra, were divided into 3 traits according to the first (citrate1), second (citrate2), and third to fifth parity (citrate3+). Genomic information for 566,170 SNPs was available for 4,479 animals. A multiple-trait repeatability model was used to estimate genetic parameters. A single-step GWAS was used to identify candidate genes for citrate and post-GWAS analysis was done to investigate the relationship and function of the identified candidate genes. The heritabilities estimated for citrate1, citrate2, and citrate3+ were 0.40, 0.37, and 0.35, respectively. The genetic correlations among the 3 traits ranged from 0.98 to 0.99. The genomic correlations among the 3 traits were also close to 1.00 across the genomic regions (1 Mb) in the whole genome, which means that citrate can be considered as a single trait in the first 5 parities. In total, 603 significant SNPs located on 3 genomic regions (chromosome 7, 68.569-68.575 Mb; chromosome 14, 0.15-1.90 Mb; and chromosome 20, 54.00-64.28 Mb), were identified to be associated with milk citrate. We identified 89 candidate genes including GPT, ANKH, PPP1R16A, and 32 QTL reported in the literature related to the identified significant SNPs. These identified QTL were mainly reported associated with milk fatty acids and metabolic diseases in dairy cows. This study suggests that milk citrate in Holstein cows is highly heritable and has the potential to be used as an early proxy for the negative energy balance of Holstein cows in a breeding objective",PubMed
BioMedLM: A 2.7B Parameter Language Model Trained On Biomedical Text,"Models such as GPT-4 and Med-PaLM 2 have demonstrated impressive performance on a wide variety of biomedical NLP tasks. However, these models have hundreds of billions of parameters, are computationally expensive to run, require users to send their input data over the internet, and are trained on unknown data sources. Can smaller, more targeted models compete? To address this question, we build and release BioMedLM, a 2.7 billion parameter GPT-style autoregressive model trained exclusively on PubMed abstracts and full articles. When fine-tuned, BioMedLM can produce strong multiple-choice biomedical question-answering results competitive with much larger models, such as achieving a score of 57.3% on MedMCQA (dev) and 69.0% on the MMLU Medical Genetics exam. BioMedLM can also be fine-tuned to produce useful answers to patient questions on medical topics. This demonstrates that smaller models can potentially serve as transparent, privacy-preserving, economical and environmentally friendly foundations for particular NLP applications, such as in biomedicine. The model is available on the Hugging Face Hub: https://huggingface.co/stanford-crfm/BioMedLM",arXiv
Tabular deep learning: a comparative study applied to multi-task genome-wide prediction,"More accurate prediction of phenotype traits can increase the success of genomic selection in both plant and animal breeding studies and provide more reliable disease risk prediction in humans. Traditional approaches typically use regression models based on linear assumptions between the genetic markers and the traits of interest. Non-linear models have been considered as an alternative tool for modeling genomic interactions (i.e. non-additive effects) and other subtle non-linear patterns between markers and phenotype. Deep learning has become a state-of-the-art non-linear prediction method for sound, image and language data. However, genomic data is better represented in a tabular format. The existing literature on deep learning for tabular data proposes a wide range of novel architectures and reports successful results on various datasets. Tabular deep learning applications in genome-wide prediction (GWP) are still rare. In this work, we perform an overview of the main families of recent deep learning architectures for tabular data and apply them to multi-trait regression and multi-class classification for GWP on real gene datasets. The study involves an extensive overview of recent deep learning architectures for tabular data learning: NODE, TabNet, TabR, TabTransformer, FT-Transformer, AutoInt, GANDALF, SAINT and LassoNet. These architectures are applied to multi-trait GWP. Comprehensive benchmarks of various tabular deep learning methods are conducted to identify best practices and determine their effectiveness compared to traditional methods. Extensive experimental results on several genomic datasets (three for multi-trait regression and two for multi-class classification) highlight LassoNet as a standout performer, surpassing both other tabular deep learning models and the highly efficient tree based LightGBM method in terms of both best prediction accuracy and computing efficiency. Through series of evaluations on real-world genomic datasets, the study identifies LassoNet as a standout performer, surpassing decision tree methods like LightGBM and other tabular deep learning architectures in terms of both predictive accuracy and computing efficiency. Moreover, the inherent variable selection property of LassoNet provides a systematic way to find important genetic markers that contribute to phenotype expression",PubMed
Chatbot Artificial Intelligence for Genetic Cancer Risk Assessment and Counseling: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Most individuals with a hereditary cancer syndrome are unaware of their genetic status to underutilization of hereditary cancer risk assessment. Chatbots, or programs that use artificial intelligence to simulate conversation, have emerged as a promising tool in health care and, more recently, as a potential tool for genetic cancer risk assessment and counseling. Here, we evaluated the existing literature on the use of chatbots in genetic cancer risk assessment and counseling. A systematic review was conducted using key electronic databases to identify studies which use chatbots for genetic cancer risk assessment and counseling. Eligible studies were further subjected to meta-analysis. Seven studies met inclusion criteria, evaluating five distinct chatbots. Three studies evaluated a chatbot that could perform genetic cancer risk assessment, one study evaluated a chatbot that offered patient counseling, and three studies included both functions. The pooled estimated completion rate for the genetic cancer risk assessment was 36.7% (95% CI, 14.8 to 65.9). Two studies included comprehensive patient characteristics, and none involved a comparison group. Chatbots varied as to the involvement of a health care provider in the process of risk assessment and counseling. Chatbots have been used to streamline genetic cancer risk assessment and counseling and hold promise for reducing barriers to genetic services. Data regarding user and nonuser characteristics are lacking, as are data regarding comparative effectiveness to usual care. Future research may consider the impact of chatbots on equitable access to genetic services",PubMed
Identifying Family Structures from Obituaries and Matching them to Patients in an Electronic Heath Record,"MotivationFamily data is a valuable data source in bioinformatic research. This is because family members often share common genetic and environmental exposures. Collecting this family data is traditionally very labor intensive but advances in electronic health record (EHR) data mining has proven useful when identifying pedigrees linked to longitudinal health histories. These are called e-pedigrees. Unfortunately, e-pedigrees tend to miss the oldest generations who inherently have the longest and richest health histories. A good source of family data from older generations includes obituaries, as they have a formulaic nature making them a good candidate for natural language processing that can extract relationships to the decedent. While there have been several studies on obtaining such data from obituaries, we demonstrate for the first-time approaches that tie that information to an EHR.  ResultsNLP extraction resulted in 8,166,534 family members being abstracted from 567,279 obituaries published in the state of Wisconsin. After matching decedent and family members to patients in the EHR, we identified 109,365 unique patients that were put in 34,158 pedigrees. The largest pedigree consisted of 21 individuals. Heritability of adult height was quantified (H2= 0.51 +- .04, P=< 1.00e-07) demonstrating this datas use in genetic research. The heritability data, coupled with overlapping data in a biobank, suggested 80% - 90% of familial relationships were accurately defined. The totality of these findings demonstrate obituaries with the oldest generations can be highly informative for bioinformatic research.

Text-based Integration of Mutational Profiles for Classification and Biomarker Identification of Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms of the Pancreas,"MotivationIntraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (IPMNs) are a common cystic precursor for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Detecting these pre-malignant lesions poses a challenge for diagnostic tools due to their relatively low occurrence rate. However, a better understanding of the lesions composition could enable effective decision-making, risk assessment, treatment selection, and, most importantly, prevention.  MethodsIn this work, we introduce a new framework for integrating information from mutational profiles using transformer-based models for stratification and biomarker identification in IPMNs vs. PDAC. We show that the numerical descriptor vectors can be used to construct highly predictive Artificial Neural Networks for disease classification. The derived mutational representations can be supported by other data types (here, mRNA) and further improve the accuracy of the classifiers. Besides the AI-driven methodology for biomarker discovery in cancer research, we also propose methods to maximize AIs utility by recycling its knowledge to facilitate our limited understanding of the disease. We propose Natural Adversary Analysis - an AI-driven inference to detect IPMNs with a high probability of progression to malignancy.  ResultsThe proposed model supports 12 clinically relevant genetic biomarkers with high mutation rates (such as KRAS, GNAS, ARID1A, and CDKN2A) and suggests biomarkers not yet recognized (such as RADIL, TTN, and ZNF287). We broaden the studys scope by investigating rarely mutated genes and reveal 14 biomarkers with potential clinical importance. Several genes with low mutation rates, including TMPRSS1, CDH22, CCND2, CYFIP2, CBLL1, and OPCML, are also addressed as potential biomarkers by our framework. Finally, the predictive robustness of the identified biomarker set is validated externally on the patient data from the Moffitt Cancer Center study, including six pairs of matched tumor and normal IPMN samples. We show that the presented mutational profile (MP-derived) gene panel has equivalent predictive power to clinically driven panels.  ConclusionsHere, we show the proof-of-concept that AI can serve the clinic and discover biomarkers beyond clinically known regimes. In line with that, we propose a translational AI-based approach for 1) disease stratification (IPMNs vs. PDAC), 2) biomarker identification, and 3) transferring the model knowledge to predict cysts risk of progression",medrxiv
"Prioritizing genomic variants through neuro-symbolic, knowledge-enhanced learning","MotivationWhole-exome and genome sequencing have become common tools in diagnosing patients with rare diseases. Despite their success, this approach leaves many patients undiagnosed. A common argument is that more disease variants still await discovery, or the novelty of disease phenotypes results from a combination of variants in multiple disease-related genes. Interpreting the phenotypic consequences of genomic variants relies on information about gene functions, gene expression, physiology, and other genomic features. Phenotype-based methods to identify variants involved in genetic diseases combine molecular features with prior knowledge about the phenotypic consequences of altering gene functions. While phenotype-based methods have been successfully applied to prioritizing variants, such methods are based on known gene-disease or gene-phenotype associations as training data and are applicable to genes that have phenotypes associated, thereby limiting their scope. In addition, phenotypes are not assigned uniformly by different clinicians, and phenotype-based methods need to account for this variability.  ResultsWe developed an Embedding-based Phenotype Variant Predictor (EmbedPVP), a computational method to prioritize variants involved in genetic diseases by combining genomic information and clinical phenotypes. EmbedPVP leverages a large amount of background knowledge from human and model organisms about molecular mechanisms through which abnormal phenotypes may arise. Specifically, EmbedPVP incorporates phenotypes linked to genes, functions of gene products, and the anatomical site of gene expression, and systematically relates them to their phenotypic effects through neuro-symbolic, knowledge-enhanced machine learning. We demonstrate EmbedPVPs efficacy on a large set of synthetic genomes and genomes matched with clinical information.

Light and shade of multigene panel testing for hereditary cancer: Examples from the real world,"MultiGene Panel Testing (MGPT) allows for simultaneous analysis of multiple cancer-related genes, enabling the identification of pathogenic variants in genes beyond those that would be analyzed based on a specific phenotype. However, a relevant fraction of variants so identified has little or no clinical utility, raising the need for guidance in selecting genes to include in panels and for interpretation of the results. Taking advantage of seven real paradigmatic cases, we analyze some of the scenarios where MGPT constitutes a meaningful advantage for diagnosis, as well as situations where panel use increases the risk of misinterpretation or complicates result communication and management. The use of MGPT facilitates prompt diagnosis in carriers of variants in rare genes (such as NTHL1), which would be diagnosed at a later stage if using a step-wise approach, as well as in carriers of bi-allelic variants (for instance in BRCA or MMR genes) leading to atypical phenotypes. Conversely, finding variants in moderate penetrance genes, such as ATM and CHEK2, may complicate interpretation and clinical management. Furthermore, for some of the genes included in MGPT, for instance NBN, the association with cancer risk has been questioned, leading to potentially misleading results. Taken together, the cases here described provide some examples of the benefits, as well as risks, involved by the use of MGPT, which may increase awareness among users and reinforce the need for establishing clear recommendations on genes to be included and management of the results",PubMed
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Medical Multimodal Large Language Models for Medical Visual Grounding,"Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inherit the superior text understanding capabilities of LLMs and extend these capabilities to multimodal scenarios. These models achieve excellent results in the general domain of multimodal tasks. However, in the medical domain, the substantial training costs and the requirement for extensive medical data pose challenges to the development of medical MLLMs. Furthermore, due to the free-text form of answers, tasks such as visual grounding that need to produce output in a prescribed form become difficult for MLLMs. So far, there have been no medical MLLMs works in medical visual grounding area. For the medical vision grounding task, which involves identifying locations in medical images based on short text descriptions, we propose Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning medical multimodal large language models for Medcial Visual Grounding (PFMVG). To validate the performance of the model, we evaluate it on a public benchmark dataset for medical visual grounding, where it achieves competitive results, and significantly outperforming GPT-4v. Our code will be open sourced after peer review",arXiv
One-Versus-Others Attention: Scalable Multimodal Integration for Biomedical Data,"Multimodal models have become increasingly important as they surpass single-modality approaches on diverse tasks ranging from question-answering to disease diagnosis. Despite the importance of multimodal learning, existing efforts focus on vision-language applications, where the number of modalities rarely exceeds four (images, text, audio, video). However, data in healthcare domain, may include many more modalities like X-rays, PET scans, MRIs, genetic screening, genomic data, and clinical notes, creating a need for both efficient and accurate data integration. Many state-of-the-art multimodal models rely on cross-attention or self-attention for effective data integration, which do not scale well for applications with more than two modalities. The complexity per layer of computing attention in either paradigm is, at best, quadratic with respect to the number of modalities, posing a computational bottleneck that impedes broad adoption. To address this, we propose a new attention mechanism, One-Versus-Others (OvO) attention, that scales linearly with the number of modalities, thus offering a significant reduction in computational complexity compared to existing multimodal attention methods. Using three clinical datasets with multiple diverse modalities, we show that our method decreases computation costs while maintaining or increasing performance compared to popular integration techniques. Across all clinical datasets, OvO reduced the number of required floating point operations (FLOPs) by at least 91.98%, demonstrating its significant impact on efficiency and enabling multi-modal predictions in healthcare

Longitudinal modeling of multimorbidity trajectories using large language models,"Multimorbidity, the co-occurrence of two or more chronic conditions within an individual, is a major and escalating global health challenge, complicating treatment regimens, straining healthcare resources, and worsening patient outcomes. The complex interplay of shared genetic predispositions, biological pathways, and socioeconomic factors underpins its development, but clinical and research efforts have largely focused on managing diseases in isolation. Understanding multimorbidity trajectories--the accumulation and interaction of chronic diseases over time--is essential to improving preventive strategies and optimizing personalized care. Here, we introduce ForeSITE (Forecasting Susceptibility to Illness with Transformer Embeddings), a novel, transformer-based framework that harnesses advanced machine learning to predict multimorbidity progression. By analyzing longitudinal data from 480,000 participants in the UK Biobank, ForeSITE identifies distinct patterns in the co-occurrence and timing of diseases. Our temporal disease network provides insights into how certain diseases might share common genetic, environmental, or socioeconomic factors, offering more specific guidance for earlier detection and more effective disease management",medrxiv
Transformers significantly improve splice site prediction,"Mutations that affect RNA splicing significantly impact human diversity and disease. Here we present a method using transformers, a type of machine learning model, to detect splicing from raw 45,000-nucleotide sequences. We generate embeddings with residual neural networks and apply hard attention to select splice site candidates, enabling efficient training on long sequences. Our method surpasses the leading tool, SpliceAI, in detecting splice sites in GENCODE and ENSEMBL annotations. Using extensive RNA sequencing data from an Icelandic cohort of 17,848 individuals and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, our method demonstrates superior performance in detecting splice junctions compared to SpliceAI-10k (PR-AUC = 0.834 vs. PR-AUC = 0.820) and is more effective at identifying disease-related splice variants in ClinVar (PR-AUC = 0.997 vs. PR-AUC = 0.996).

Systems Modeling Reveals Shared Metabolic Dysregulation and Novel Therapeutic Treatments in ME/CFS and Long COVID,"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Long COVID are complex, multisystem conditions that pose significant challenges in healthcare. Accumulated research evidence suggests that ME/CFS and Long COVID exhibit overlapping metabolic symptoms, indicating potential shared metabolic dysfunctions. This study aims to systematically explore shared metabolic disturbances in the muscle tissue of patients. Utilizing genome-wide metabolic modeling, we identified key metabolic irregularities in the muscle of patients with ME/CFS, notably the downregulation of the alanine and aspartate metabolism pathway and the arginine and proline metabolism pathway. Further, in silico knockout analyses suggested that supplementation with aspartate (ASP) or asparagine (ASN) could potentially ameliorate these metabolic deficiencies. In addition, assessments of metabolomic levels in Long COVID patients also showed the significant downregulation of ASP during post-exertional malaise (PEM) in both muscle and blood. Consequently, we propose that a combination of l-ornithine and l-aspartate (LOLA) is a potential candidate to alleviate metabolic symptoms in ME/CFS and Long COVID for future clinical trials",biorxiv
Mycobacterium paragordonae pulmonary disease with rapidly growing solitary lesions: a case report and literature review,"Mycobacterium paragordonae (MPG) is a novel and uncommon nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM). We describe a case of MPG pulmonary disease (MPGPD) with a single, rapidly growing, pulmonary mass, which has rarely been reported. A chest CT scan of a 66-year-old woman revealed a rapidly growing solitary mass-like lesion in the upper lobe of the right lung, which was not seen in the previous chest CT scan six months ago. H&E-stained section of the CT-guided percutaneous lung tissue biopsy specimen showed chronic inflammatory changes with epithelioid granulomas. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of lung tissue biopsy specimen identified MPG with a sequence number of 1617 and a confidence level of 99%. Because the subsequent MPG droplet digital PCR (MPG-ddPCR) test of the lung tissue biopsy was positive, she was eventually diagnosed with MPGPD. She was administered a quadruple oral regimen comprising clarithromycin, levofloxacin, rifampicin, and ethambutol according to the ATS/IDSA protocol for Mycobacterium gordonae (MG) infection. The chest CT scans showed a significant reduction in the lesion one month after the treatment and almost complete resolution four months later. MPGPD is a rare NTM infection. The imaging manifestations of MPGPD are diverse and may even show rapid development. mNGS of tissue biopsy can enable prompt diagnosis of MPG infection and is a good alternative to routine NTM microbial testing. The ATS/IDSA protocol for MG infection is an effective treatment for MPG infection",PubMed
Myoclonus: Differential diagnosis and current management,"Myoclonus classically presents as a brief (10-50 ms duration), non-rhythmic jerk movement. The etiology could vary considerably ranging from self-limited to chronic or even progressive disorders, the latter falling into encephalopathic pictures that need a prompt diagnosis. Beyond the etiological classification, others evaluate myoclonus' body distribution (i.e., clinical classification) or the location of the generator (i.e., neurophysiological classification); particularly, knowing the anatomical source of myoclonus gives inputs on the observable clinical patterns, such as EMG bursts duration or EEG correlate, and guides the therapeutic choices. Among all the chronic disorders, myoclonus often presents itself as a manifestation of epilepsy. In this context, myoclonus has many facets. Myoclonus occurs as one, or the only, seizure manifestation while it can also present as a peculiar type of movement disorder; moreover, its electroclinical features within specific genetically determined epileptic syndromes have seldom been investigated. In this review, following a meeting of recognized experts, we provide an up-to-date overview of the neurophysiology and nosology surrounding myoclonus. Through the dedicated exploration of epileptic syndromes, coupled with pragmatic guidance, we aim to furnish clinicians and researchers alike with practical advice for heightened diagnostic management and refined treatment strategies.

Here we present nanoBERT, a nanobody-specific transformer to predict amino acids in a given position in a query sequence. We demonstrate the need to develop such machine-learning based protocol as opposed to gene-specific positional statistics since appropriate genetic reference is not available. We benchmark nanoBERT with respect to human-based language models and ESM-2, demonstrating the benefit for domain-specific language models. We also demonstrate the benefit of employing nanobody-specific predictions for fine-tuning on experimentally measured thermostability dataset. We hope that nanoBERT will help engineers in a range of predictive tasks for designing therapeutic nanobodies. https://huggingface.co/NaturalAntibody/",PubMed
Natural Language Processing in medicine and ophthalmology: A review for the 21st-century clinician,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language, enabling computers to understand, generate, and derive meaning from human language. NLP's potential applications in the medical field are extensive and vary from extracting data from Electronic Health Records -one of its most well-known and frequently exploited uses- to investigating relationships among genetics, biomarkers, drugs, and diseases for the proposal of new medications. NLP can be useful for clinical decision support, patient monitoring, or medical image analysis. Despite its vast potential, the real-world application of NLP is still limited due to various challenges and constraints, meaning that its evolution predominantly continues within the research domain. However, with the increasingly widespread use of NLP, particularly with the availability of large language models, such as ChatGPT, it is crucial for medical professionals to be aware of the status, uses, and limitations of these technologies",PubMed
Cross-institution natural language processing for reliable clinical association studies: a methodological exploration,"Natural language processing (NLP) of clinical notes in electronic medical records is increasingly used to extract otherwise sparsely available patient characteristics, to assess their association with relevant health outcomes. Manual data curation is resource intensive and NLP methods make these studies more feasible. However, the methodology of using NLP methods reliably in clinical research is understudied. The objective of this study is to investigate how NLP models could be used to extract study variables (specifically exposures) to reliably conduct exposure-outcome association studies. In a convenience sample of patients admitted to the intensive care unit of a US academic health system, multiple association studies are conducted, comparing the association estimates based on NLP-extracted vs. manually extracted exposure variables. The association studies varied in NLP model architecture (Bidirectional Encoder Decoder from Transformers, Long Short-Term Memory), training paradigm (training a new model, fine-tuning an existing external model), extracted exposures (employment status, living status, and substance use), health outcomes (having a do-not-resuscitate/intubate code, length of stay, and in-hospital mortality), missing data handling (multiple imputation vs. complete case analysis), and the application of measurement error correction (via regression calibration). The study was conducted on 1,174 participants (median [interquartile range] age, 61 [50, 73] years; 60.6% male). Additionally, up to 500 discharge reports of participants from the same health system and 2,528 reports of participants from an external health system were used to train the NLP models. Substantial differences were found between the associations based on NLP-extracted and manually extracted exposures under all settings. The error in association was only weakly correlated with the overall F1 score of the NLP models. Associations estimated using NLP-extracted exposures should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to set conditions for reliable use of NLP in medical association studies",PubMed
Parkinson Disease Genetics Extended to African and Hispanic Ancestries in the VA Million Veteran Program,"Nearly all genetic analyses of Parkinson disease (PD) have been in populations of European ancestry. We sought to test the ability of a machine learning method to extract accurate PD diagnoses from an electronic medical record (EMR) system, to see whether genetic variants identified in European populations generalize to individuals of African and Hispanic ancestries, and to compare the rates of PD across ancestries. A machine learning method using natural language processing was applied to EMRs of US veterans participating in the VA Million Veteran Program (MVP) to identify individuals with PD. These putative cases were vetted via blind chart review by a movement disorder specialist. A polygenic risk score (PRS) of 90 established genetic variants whose genotypes were imputed from a customized Axiom Biobank Array was evaluated in different case groups. The EMR prediction scores had a distinct trimodal distribution, with 97% of the high group and only 30% of the middle group having a credible diagnosis of PD. Using the 3,542 cases from the high group matched 4:1 to controls, the PRS was highly predictive in individuals of European ancestry (n = 3,137 cases; OR = 1.82; p = 8.01E-48), and nearly identical effect sizes were seen in individuals of African (n = 184; OR = 2.07; p = 3.4E-4) and Hispanic ancestries (n = 221; OR = 2.13; p = 3.9E-6). The PRS was much less predictive for the 2,757 European ancestry cases who had an ICD code for PD but for whom the machine learning method had a lower confidence in their diagnosis. No novel ancestry-specific genetic variants were identified. Individuals with African ancestry had one-quarter the rate of PD compared with European or Hispanic ancestries aged 60-70 years and one half the rate in the 70-80 years age range. African American cases had a higher proportion of their DNA originating in Europe compared with African American controls. Machine learning can reliably classify PD using data from a large EMR. Larger studies of non-European populations are required to confirm the generalizability of PD risk variants identified in populations of European ancestry and the increased risk coming from a higher proportion of European DNA in African Americans",PubMed
Identifying Genetic Susceptibility in Neonates With Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy: A Retrospective Case Series,"Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is a clinical phenomenon that often results from perinatal asphyxia. To mitigate secondary neurologic injury, prompt initial assessment and diagnosis is needed to identify patients eligible for therapeutic hypothermia. However, occasionally neonates present with a clinical picture of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy without significant risk factors for perinatal asphyxia. We hypothesized that in patients with genetic abnormalities, the clinical manifestation of those abnormalities may overlap with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy criteria, potentially contributing to a causal misattribution. We reviewed 210 charts of infants meeting local protocol criteria for moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in neonatal intensive care units in Calgary, Alberta. All patients that met criteria for therapeutic hypothermia were eligible for the study. Data were collected surrounding pregnancy and birth histories, as well as any available genetic or metabolic testing including microarray, gene panels, whole-exome sequencing, and newborn metabolic screens. Twenty-eight patients had genetic testing such as microarray, whole-exome sequencing, or a gene panel, because of clinical suspicion. Ten of 28 patients had genetic mutations, including CDKL5, pyruvate dehydrogenase, CFTR, CYP21A2, ISY1, KIF1A, KCNQ2, SCN9A, MTFMT, and NPHP1. All patients lacked significant risk factors to support a moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy diagnosis. Treatment was changed in 2 patients because of confirmed genetic etiology. This study demonstrates the importance of identifying genetic comorbidities as potential contributors to a hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy phenotype in neonates. Early identification of clinical factors that support an alternate diagnosis should be considered when the patient's clinical picture is not typical of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and could aid in both treatment decisions and outcome prognostication",PubMed
KDM4A promotes the progression of neuroendocrine prostate cancer,"Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) represents one of the most lethal forms of prostate cancer (PCa) and lacks life-prolonging treatment. The incidence of NEPC is increased due to the widespread use of AR pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) in the treatment of non-metastatic CRPC and hormone-sensitive metastatic tumors. Here, we identified histone lysine demethylase KDM4A as a key player in NEPC progression and an effective therapeutic target. We found that KDM4A mRNA and protein are overexpressed in human and mouse NEPC compared to prostate adenocarcinoma. Knockdown (KD) or knockout (KO) of KDM4A in NEPC cell lines suppressed cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that KDM4A promotes NEPC progression, in part, through direct transcriptional regulation of MYC. We showed that MYC is hyper-activated in human and mouse NEPC. KDM4A KD led to suppression of MYC signaling. MYC KD or inhibition profoundly suppressed NEPC cell proliferation. Furthermore, a potent pan-KDM4 inhibitor QC6352 significantly reduced NEPC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, we demonstrated that KDM4A is an important regulator of NEPC progression and targeting KDM4A may potentially be an effective therapeutic strategy for NEPC.  SignificanceNeuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is a highly aggressive prostate cancer subtype that is resistant to potent androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) and currently lacks effective therapeutic options. Histone lysine demethylase KDM4A is an important epigenetic regulator of gene expression in development and cancer. In this study, we show that KDM4A is highly expressed in NEPC and is required for NEPC proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and in vivo growth, which is in part mediated through the regulation of MYC expression. Importantly, we demonstrate that inhibition of KDM4A significantly impairs NEPC growth in preclinical models. Thus, our findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying NEPC progression and offer a rationale for clinical trials with KDM4 inhibitor in NEPC patients",biorxiv
Effects of Nf1 on sleep behavior are mediated through starvation caused by deficits in SARM1 dependent NAD+ metabolism,"Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a relatively common autosomal dominant disease which predisposes to the formation of tumors, and is also associated with behavioral phenotypes, including sleep disturbances. As loss of the NF1 protein has been recently associated with metabolic dysfunction, we explored the relationship between metabolic and behavioral phenotypes through metabolomic analysis of Drosophila Nf1-null mutants. Nf1-null mutants exhibit a metabolic signature indicative of starvation, with diminished metabolites related to glucose, glycogen, and fatty acid processing and increased mRNA of Akh, a hormone that promotes foraging during starvation. Reduced sleep in Nf1-null mutants was rescued by genetic manipulation of the AKH pathway and by a high-sucrose diet, which also partially corrected hypolipidemia, suggesting that sleep loss is due to starvation-induced foraging. Interestingly, behavioral phenotypes can be recapitulated by loss of NF1 only in the periphery and trace to mitochondrial defects that include elevated levels of the NADase SARM1. Indeed, inhibition of SARM1 activity rescues sleep behavior in Nf1-null flies. These findings suggest a novel connection between loss of NF1 and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by SARM1 hyperactivation, setting the scene for new pharmacological and dietary approaches that could provide relief to NF1 patients",biorxiv
Interdisciplinary care of facial plexiform neurofibroma: a case report,"Neurofibromatosis is considered a rare genetic disorder primarily affecting neural tissues. The most common type is neurofibromatosis type 1, which is characterized by plexiform neurofibromas. We report a case of a 30-year-old Rag-lay ethnic woman with facial plexiform neurofibroma, which not only infiltrated the left eye socket but also caused destruction of temporal bone and facial deformity. The disease started in her childhood, and she had numerous neurofibromas on her trunk and limb at the time of the hospital admission. The patient was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis 1 based on clinical symptoms, computed tomography images, and histopathologic result. For safety, we divided treatment into two phases. For the first phase, we dealt with the blood supply and meningeal suture, and then we performed surgical resection and skin flap reconstruction surgery. The main therapy for plexiform neurofibroma is surgery, which aims at tumor removal and management of complications. However, the treatment plan is different in each case based on the nature and extent of tumor, which requires more verification and clinical practice",PubMed
SciConNav: Knowledge navigation through contextual learning of extensive scientific research trajectories,"New knowledge builds upon existing foundations, which means an interdependent relationship exists between knowledge, manifested in the historical development of the scientific system for hundreds of years. By leveraging natural language processing techniques, this study introduces the Scientific Concept Navigator (SciConNav), an embedding-based navigation model to infer the ""knowledge pathway"" from the research trajectories of millions of scholars. We validate that the learned representations effectively delineate disciplinary boundaries and capture the intricate relationships between diverse concepts. The utility of the inferred navigation space is showcased through multiple applications. Firstly, we demonstrated the multi-step analogy inferences within the knowledge space and the interconnectivity between concepts in different disciplines. Secondly, we formulated the attribute dimensions of knowledge across domains, observing the distributional shifts in the arrangement of 19 disciplines along these conceptual dimensions, including ""Theoretical"" to ""Applied"", and ""Chemical"" to ""Biomedical', highlighting the evolution of functional attributes within knowledge domains. Lastly, by analyzing the high-dimensional knowledge network structure, we found that knowledge connects with shorter global pathways, and interdisciplinary knowledge plays a critical role in the accessibility of the global knowledge network. Our framework offers a novel approach to mining knowledge inheritance pathways in extensive scientific literature, which is of great significance for understanding scientific progression patterns, tailoring scientific learning trajectories, and accelerating scientific progress",arXiv
End-of-Life Discussions With Patients and Caregivers Affected By Neurogenetic Diseases,"No effective cure is available for neurogenetic diseases such as Huntington disease, spinocerebellar ataxias, and Friedreich ataxia, all of which cause progressive motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms leading, in the long term, to severe communication (among other) impairments. In end-of-life situations, advanced directives (indications formulated by the patient about end-of-life choices) are one decision-making resource for relatives, caregivers, and health care professionals. Given the slowly progressive nature of these diseases, the related disabilities, and their hereditary component, patients, caregivers, and neurologists are often at a loss concerning the right course of action to take. Our study's aim was to explore patients' and caregivers' perceptions, needs, and expectations around anticipated end-of-life discussions and advanced directives. DIRAGENE is an observational, cross-sectional, mixed-methods study with a patient-centered component and a primary caregiver-centered component. Observations include disease severity, psychosocial, and emotional scales; in-house questionnaires; and semidirected interviews. We included 124 participants, of which 81 were patients and 43 primary caregivers. Only 16% of the participants knew specifically about advanced directives and 7% had written documents vs 30% and 18% in the general French population, respectively, adjusted for age. Qualitative analysis of the interviews with 15 couples showed notable dissimilarities in ideas about advanced directives between patients and caregivers and that the underlying pathology, severity, and inheritability are less relevant factors regarding end-of-life discussions than age, environment, prior experiences with death, and history of family illness. Most patients (95%) and caregivers (98%) found that participating in the study was helpful in bringing awareness to end-of-life issues, wished to prioritize discussing them with loved ones, and requested assistance in managing them throughout the course of the disease. Being affected by severe neurogenetic diseases does not seem to prompt individuals to give much thought to end-of-life planning. However, patients and caregivers welcome comprehensive information and expect progressive support from trained health care professionals in having such discussions. Routine integration of these conversations into medical management through a holistic and adapted approach will benefit patients with illnesses with unfavorable long-term prognoses",PubMed
Fructose Induced KHK-C Increases ER Stress and Modulates Hepatic Transcriptome to Drive Liver Disease in Diet-Induced and Genetic Models of NAFLD,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a liver manifestation of metabolic syndrome, and is estimated to affect one billion individuals worldwide. An increased intake of a high-fat diet (HFD) and sugar-sweetened beverages are risk-factors for NAFLD development, but how their combined intake promotes progression to a more severe form of liver injury is unknown. Here we show that fructose metabolism via ketohexokinase (KHK) C isoform increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in a dose dependent fashion, so when fructose is coupled with a HFD intake it leads to unresolved ER stress. Conversely, a liver-specific knockdown of KHK in C57BL/6J male mice consuming fructose on a HFD is adequate to improve the NAFLD activity score and exert a profound effect on the hepatic transcriptome. Overexpression of KHK-C in cultured hepatocytes is sufficient to induce ER stress in fructose free media. Upregulation of KHK-C is also observed in genetically obesity ob/ob, db/db and lipodystrophic FIRKO male mice, whereas KHK knockdown in these mice improves metabolic function. Additionally, in over 100 inbred strains of male or female mice hepatic KHK expression correlates positively with adiposity, insulin resistance, and liver triglycerides. Similarly, in 241 human subjects and their controls, hepatic Khk expression is upregulated in early, but not late stages of NAFLD. In summary, we describe a novel role of KHK-C in triggering ER stress, which offers a mechanistic understanding of how the combined intake of fructose and a HFD propagates the development of metabolic complications",biorxiv
Genetic deconvolution of embryonic and maternal cell-free DNA in spent culture medium of human preimplantation embryos through deep learning,"Noninvasive preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy based on embryonic cell-free DNA (cfDNA) released in spent embryo culture media (SECM) has brought hope in selecting embryos that are most likely to implant and grow into healthy babies during assisted reproduction. However, maternal DNA contamination in SECM significantly hampers the reliability of embryonic chromosome ploidy profiles, leading to false negative results, particularly at high contamination levels. Here, we present DECENT (deep copy number variation (CNV) reconstruction), a deep learning method to reconstruct embryonic CNVs and mitigate maternal contamination in SECM from single-cell methylation sequencing of cfDNA. DECENT integrates sequence features and methylation patterns by combining convolution modules, long-short memory, and attention mechanisms to infer the origin of cfDNA reads. The benchmarking study demonstrated DECENTs ability to estimate contamination proportions and restore embryonic chromosome aneuploidies in samples with varying contamination levels. In contaminated SECM clinical samples, including one with more than 80% maternal reads, DECENT achieved consistent CNV recovery with invasive tests. Overall, DECENT contributes to enhancing the diagnostic accuracy and effectiveness of cfDNA-based noninvasive preimplantation genetic testing, establishing a robust groundwork for its extensive clinical utilization in the field of reproductive medicine",biorxiv
Under-Representation of Racial Groups in Genomics Studies of Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms,"Not all populations are poised to benefit from advancing genomics in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NEN), as genomics have focused on White patients. This study aimed to evaluate racial populations represented in genomic studies of GEP-NENs and to provide evidence of differential genomic findings between racial groups in GEP-NENs. Manuscripts analyzing DNA, RNA, or DNA methylation in GEP-NENs were queried using PUBMED and EMBASE. NIH race/ethnicity term frequency was then determined by Natural Language Processing, followed by manual evaluation of tumor types and subjects by racial group. IHC of institutional tissue micro-arrays and analysis of AACR GENIE data analyzed was performed to determine mutational differences between Black and White pancreatic NEN (pNEN) patients. 313 manuscripts conducted the requisite genomic analyses, 16 of which included subject race data. Race data were included in 13/184 DNA, 4/107 RNA, and 1/54 DNA Methylation analyses. These studies included 89% White subjects (n = 2032), 5.8% Asian subjects (n = 132), 4.0% ""Other"" subjects (n = 93), and 1.2% Black subjects (n = 27). No Native American/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, or ethnically Hispanic/Latinx subjects were represented. There were significant differences in MEN1 mutations among Black and White patients in immunohistochemical (13:40) and GENIE data (24:268 patients per group, respectively), with 9 additional genes differentially mutated in the GENIE dataset. Genomic sequencing data for GEP-NENs is almost racially homogenous. Differences in pNEN genomics may exist between racial groups, highlighting a need for diversity in future genomic analyses of GEP-NENs to understand the putative influence of interracial genomic variation on GEP-NEN prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. There is little diversity in genomic studies of GEP-NENs, which may exhibit clinically impactful variation in their tumor biology among racial groups. Improved diversity in such studies is imperative for understanding this variation and its potential impacts on disease prevention, diagnosis, therapeutic targeting, and clinical outcomes",PubMed
"What Goes In, Must Come Out: Generative Artificial Intelligence Does Not Present Algorithmic Bias Across Race and Gender in Medical Residency Specialties","Objective Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant inroads into various domains, including medicine, raising concerns about algorithmic bias. This study investigates the presence of biases in generative AI programs, with a specific focus on gender and racial representations across 19 medical residency specialties. Methodology This comparative study utilized DALL-E2 to generate faces representing 19 distinct residency training specialties, as identified by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), which were then compared to the AAMC's residency specialty breakdown with respect to race and gender. Results Our findings reveal an alignment between OpenAI's DALL-E2's predictions and the current demographic landscape of medical residents, suggesting an absence of algorithmic bias in this AI model. Conclusion This revelation gives rise to important ethical considerations. While AI excels at pattern recognition, it inherits and mirrors the biases present in its training data. To combat AI bias, addressing real-world disparities is imperative. Initiatives to promote inclusivity and diversity within medicine are commendable and contribute to reshaping medical education. This study underscores the need for ongoing efforts to dismantle barriers and foster inclusivity in historically male-dominated medical fields, particularly for underrepresented populations. Ultimately, our findings underscore the crucial role of real-world data quality in mitigating AI bias. As AI continues to shape healthcare and education, the pursuit of equitable, unbiased AI applications should remain at the forefront of these transformative endeavors",PubMed
Enhancing HBV-specific T cell responses through a combination of epigenetic modulation and immune checkpoint inhibition,"ObjectiveChronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection results in the exhaustion of HBV-specific T cells and the development of epigenetic imprints that impair immune responses and limit the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy, such as PD-L1. This study aimed to determine whether the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine (DAC) can reverse these epigenetic imprints and enhance the efficacy of ICI in restoring HBV-specific T cell responses.  MethodsWe investigated HBV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses by 10-day in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with chronic HBV infection. PBMCs were stimulated with HBV core-specific overlapping peptide pools and HLA-A*02-restricted peptides, including core18 and pol455. The immunomodulatory effect of the combination of DAC/PD-L1 was assessed via flow cytometry. Responder stratification was investigated by comparison of clinical characteristics, ex vivo DNA methylation analysis of PBMCs, and determination of IFN{gamma} plasma levels.  ResultsTreatment with DAC and PD-L1 enhanced HBV-specific CD4+ T cell responses in a significant proportion of 53 patients, albeit with variability. The effect was independent of the HBcrAg level. Ex vivo DNA methylation revealed hypermethylation of key genes like IFNG among DAC-responders versus non-responders, supported by altered ex vivo IFN{gamma} plasma levels. Further analysis of HBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses in 22 HLA-A*02-positive patients indicated distinct response patterns between HBV-core18- and HBV-pol455-specific T cells, with pol455-specific CD8+ T cells showing increased susceptibility to DAC/PD-L1, surpassing PD-L1 monotherapy response.  ConclusionsThe combination of DAC and PD-L1 shows promising effects in improving HBV-specific T cell responses in vitro. Our study highlights the potential of remodeling exhaustion-associated epigenetic signatures to enhance HBV-specific T cell restoration, suggesting a novel immunotherapeutic avenue for chronic HBV infections.

Study Design and Interim Analysis of the Cancer Lifetime Assessment Screening Study in Canines (CLASSiC): The First Prospective Cancer Screening Study in Dogs Using Next-Generation Sequencing-Based Liquid Biopsy,"ObjectiveThe Cancer Lifetime Assessment Screening Study in Canines (CLASSiC) is a prospective, longitudinal cancer screening study, in which enrolled dogs are screened for cancer with physical exams and next-generation sequencing-based liquid biopsy testing on a serial basis. The goals of the first interim analysis, presented here, are to assess the benefits of using the OncoK9(R) liquid biopsy test as a cancer screening tool in a prospective clinical setting, and to demonstrate test performance for cancer detection, including preclinical detection.  Subjects726 presumably cancer-free client-owned dogs were prospectively enrolled in the study across 24 clinical sites in the US and Canada. Most subjects were at high risk of cancer at the time of enrollment based on age and/or breed. 419 dogs that were enrolled for at least one year and had at least two cancer screening study visits, or that had received a definitive or presumptive diagnosis of cancer up to the time of the interim analysis, were included in the analysis.  MethodsClinical data and a blood sample were collected at each study visit (once or twice per year and when cancer was clinically suspected). Cell-free DNA extracted from plasma was tested by OncoK9(R) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology.  Results417 dogs were eligible for inclusion in the interim analysis and had classifiable outcomes, with a mean on-study duration of 422 days. Of these, 51 dogs were newly diagnosed with cancer (37 definitive, 14 presumptive), translating to a 12% (51/417) observed incidence over the study period; the liver, skin, bone, heart, spleen, lung, and lymph node(s) were the most common anatomic locations for disease. The prospectively observed sensitivity (detection rate) of the test was 56.9% (95% CI: 42.3-70.4%) with a specificity of 98.9% (95% CI: 97.0-99.6%). The prospectively observed positive predictive value was 87.9% (95% CI: 70.9-96.0%) and the negative predictive value was 94.3% (95% CI: 91.3-96.3%). NGS-based liquid biopsy doubled the overall number of cancer cases detected in this study population (from 25 to 51); remarkably, the detection rate for preclinical cancer was increased 4.6-fold from 12% (6/51) by routine care alone to 55% (28/51) by combining routine care with OncoK9(R) testing.  Clinical RelevanceCLASSiC is the [fi]rst study to prospectively document the incidence of cancer in a predominantly high-risk canine population, and to prospectively demonstrate that the addition of NGS-based cancer screening to regularly scheduled wellness visits has the potential to substantially increase preclinical cancer detection in this population",biorxiv
Unpacking Unstructured Data: A Pilot Study on Extracting Insights from Neuropathological Reports of Parkinson's Disease Patients using Large Language Models,"ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to make unstructured neuropathological data, located in the NeuroBioBank (NBB), follow FAIR principles, and investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in wrangling unstructured neuropathological reports. By making the currently inconsistent and disparate data findable, our overarching goal was to enhance research output and speed.  Materials and MethodsThe NBB catalog currently includes information from medical records, interview results, and neuropathological reports. These reports contain crucial information necessary for conducting in-depth analysis of NBB data but have multiple formats that vary across different NBB biorepositories and change over time. In this study we focused on a subset of 822 donors with Parkinsons disease (PD) from 7 NBB biorepositories. We developed a data model with combined Brain Region and Pathological Findings data at its core. This approach made it easier to build an extraction pipeline and was flexible enough to convert resulting data to Common Data Elements (CDEs), a standardized data collection tools used by the neuroscience community to improve consistency and facilitate data sharing across studies.  ResultsThis pilot study demonstrated the potential of LLMs in structuring unstructured neuropathological reports of PD patients available in the NBB. The pipeline enabled successful extraction of detailed tissue-level (microscopic) and gross anatomical (macroscopic) observations, along with staging information from pathology reports, with extraction quality comparable to manual curation results. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to automatically standardize neuropathological information at this scale. The collected data has the potential to serve as a valuable resource for PD researchers, facilitating integration with clinical information and genetic data (such as genome-wide genotyping and whole genome sequencing) available through the NBB, hereby enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the disease",biorxiv
Cellular contributions to ictal population signals,"ObjectiveThe amplitude of ictal activity is a defining feature of epileptic seizures, but the determinants of this amplitude have not been identified. Clinically, ictal amplitudes are measured electrographically (using e.g. EEG, ECoG, and depth electrodes), but these methods do not enable the assessment of the activity of individual neurons. To identify the cellular determinants of the ictal signal, we measured single cell and population electrical activity and neuronal calcium levels via optical imaging of the genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) GCaMP.  MethodsSpontaneous seizure activity was assessed in an awake, behaving mouse model of focal cortical injury and in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSC), an in vitro preparation from which recurrent seizures can be readily captured. Single cell calcium signals were linked to a range of electrical activities by performing simultaneous GECI-based calcium imaging and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in spontaneously seizing OHSCs. Neuronal resolution calcium imaging was then performed during spontaneous seizures in vivo and in vitro to quantify the cellular contributions to the population-level calcium signal.  ResultsPopulation signal may increase from three potential sources: 1) increased synchrony, i.e. more co-active neurons, 2) altered active state, from bursts of action potentials and/or paroxysmal depolarizing shifts in membrane potential, and 3) altered subthreshold state, which includes all lower levels of activity. The largest contributor to the signal recorded at seizure onset was increased subthreshold activity, consistent with either barrages of excitatory postsynaptic potentials or sustained membrane depolarization. The relative contribution of synchrony increased as seizures progressed, but cell intrinsic alterations in both the subthreshold and active states remained the largest driver of the ictal signal.  SignificanceWe introduce here a novel method for the quantification of the relative contributions of inter-versus intra-cellular changes to provide a critical link between single neuron activity and population measures of seizure activity.  Key PointsO_LINeuronal calcium as measured by GCaMP reports a range of membrane depolarizations, from EPSPs to action potential firing and paroxysmal depolarizing shifts C_LIO_LIThe mean population calcium signal is highly correlated with the electrographic local field potential C_LIO_LIIncreased calcium signal during seizure onset is largely driven by increased subthreshold calcium within individual neurons C_LIO_LIRecruitment of newly active neurons is a minor contributor to the increasing population-level signal during the transition to frank seizure C_LI",biorxiv
Empowering Personalized Pharmacogenomics with Generative AI Solutions,"ObjectiveThis study evaluates an AI assistant developed using OpenAIs GPT-4 for interpreting pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing results, aiming to improve decision-making and knowledge sharing in clinical genetics, and to enhance patient care with equitable access.  MethodsThe AI assistant employs Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combining retrieval and generative techniques. It employs a Knowledge Base (KB) comprising Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) data, with context-aware GPT-4 generating tailored responses to user queries from this KB, refined through prompt engineering and guardrails.  ResultsEvaluated against a specialized PGx question catalog, the AI assistant showed high efficacy in addressing user queries. Compared with OpenAIs ChatGPT 3.5, it demonstrated better performance, especially in provider-specific queries requiring specialized data and citations. Key areas for improvement include enhancing accuracy, relevancy, and representative language in responses.  DiscussionThe integration of context-aware GPT-4 with RAG significantly enhanced the AI assistants utility. RAGs ability to incorporate domain-specific CPIC data, including recent literature, proved beneficial. Challenges persist, such as the need for specialized genetic/PGx models to improve accuracy and relevancy and addressing ethical, regulatory, and safety concerns.  ConclusionThis study underscores generative AIs potential for transforming healthcare provider support and patient accessibility to complex pharmacogenomic information. While careful implementation of large language models like GPT-4 is necessary, it is clear that they can substantially improve understanding of pharmacogenomic data. With further development, these tools could augment healthcare expertise, provider productivity, and the delivery of equitable, patient-centered healthcare services",medrxiv
"Safety and efficacy of bronchus-blocked ultrasound-guided percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy (BUS-PTNB) for critically ill patients under invasive mechanical ventilation: a prospective, single-arm trial","ObjectivesConventional lung biopsy for critically ill patients who under invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is limited due to high risks of procedure-related complications. We developed a novel technique named bronchus-blocked ultrasound-guided percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy (BUS-PTNB) to mitigate the risks of biopsy under IMV, but its safety and efficacy have not been prospectively evaluated.  MethodsIn this prospective, single-arm trial (Chictr.org, ChiCTR2100054047), invasively ventilated patients with undiagnosed lung opacities were screened and underwent BUS-PTNB after enrollment. The peri-operative conditions, severity of complications, pathological findings, and tissue-based metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) results were systemically evaluated.  ResultsA total of 22 critically ill patients (18 men, mean age, 64.2 years [SD 11.7], APACHE II score, 27.0 [SD 5.6], PaO2/FiO2 ratio, 120.5 [IQR 91.9-169.1]) under IMV were enrolled in the study. Throughout the procedure, there were no significant changes in respiratory rate or PaO2. Biopsy-related complications occurred in 3 patients (13.6%), including pneumothorax (n=1, 4.5%), intrabronchial hemorrhage (n=2, 9.1%), and hemothorax (n=3, 13.6%). Notably, one patient (P10) required a blood transfusion due to hemothorax, which was classified as a severe complication (1/22, 4.5%). Satisfactory biopsy samples were obtained from 21 patients (95.5%) for pathological study and from all 22 patients (100%) for mNGS.  ConclusionsThe novel BUS-PTNB is a promising bedside biopsy technique for ICU patients under IMV with acceptable complication risk.

"Molecular Matchmakers: Phytoplasma Effector SAP54 Targets MADS-Box Factor SVP to Enhance Attraction of Fecund Female Vectors by Modulating Leaf Responses to Male Presence
==========
Phytoplasma Targeting of MADS-Box Factor SVP Suppresses Leaf Responses to Insect Vector Males, Promoting Female Attraction and Colonization","Obligate parasites often trigger significant changes in their hosts to facilitate transmission to new hosts. The molecular mechanisms behind these extended phenotypes - where genetic information of one organism is manifested as traits in another - remain largely unclear. This study explores the role of the virulence protein SAP54, produced by parasitic phytoplasmas, in attracting leafhopper vectors. SAP54 is responsible for the induction of leaf-like flowers in phytoplasma-infected plants. However, we previously demonstrated that the insects were attracted to leaves and the leaf-like flowers were not required. Here we made the surprising discovery that leaf exposure to leafhopper males is required for the attraction phenotype, suggesting a leaf response that distinguishes leafhopper sex in the presence of SAP54. In contrast, this phytoplasma effector alongside leafhopper females discourages further female colonization. We demonstrate that SAP54 effectively suppresses biotic stress response pathways in leaves exposed to the males. Critically, the host plant MADS-box transcription factor SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) emerges as a key element in the female leafhopper preference for plants exposed to males, with SAP54 promoting the degradation of SVP. This preference extends to female colonization of male-exposed svp null mutant plants over those not exposed to males. Our research underscores the dual role of the phytoplasma effector SAP54 in host development alteration and vector attraction - integral to the phytoplasma life cycle. Importantly, we clarify how SAP54, by targeting SVP, heightens leaf vulnerability to leafhopper males, thus facilitating female attraction and subsequent plant colonization by the insects. SAP54 essentially acts as a molecular ""matchmaker,"" helping male leafhoppers more easily locate mates by degrading SVP-containing complexes in leaves. This study not only provides insights into the long reach of single parasite genes in extended phenotypes, but also opens avenues for understanding how transcription factors that regulate plant developmental processes intersect with and influence plant-insect interactions",biorxiv
The mediating role of mammographic density in the protective effect of early-life adiposity on breast cancer risk: a multivariable Mendelian randomization study,"Observational studies suggest that mammographic density (MD) may have a role in the unexplained protective effect of childhood adiposity on breast cancer risk. Here, we investigated a complex and interlinked relationship between puberty onset, adiposity, MD, and their effects on breast cancer using Mendelian randomization (MR).  We estimated the effects of childhood and adulthood adiposity, and age at menarche on MD phenotypes (dense area (DA), non-dense area (NDA), percent density (PD)) using MR and multivariable MR (MVMR), allowing us to disentangle their total and direct effects. Next, we examined the effect of MD on breast cancer risk, including risk of molecular subtypes, and accounting for genetic pleiotropy. Finally, we used MVMR to evaluate whether the protective effect of childhood adiposity on breast cancer was mediated by MD.  Childhood adiposity had a strong inverse effect on mammographic DA, while adulthood adiposity increased NDA. Later menarche had an effect of increasing DA and PD, but when accounting for childhood adiposity, this effect attenuated to the null. DA and PD had a risk-increasing effect on breast cancer across all subtypes. The MD single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) estimates were extremely heterogeneous, and examination of the SNPs suggested different mechanisms may be linking MD and breast cancer. Finally, MR mediation analysis estimated that 56% (95% CIs [32% - 79%]) of the childhood adiposity effect on breast cancer risk was mediated via DA.  In this work, we sought to disentangle the relationship between factors affecting MD and breast cancer. We showed that higher childhood adiposity decreases mammographic DA, which subsequently leads to reduced breast cancer risk. Understanding this mechanism is of great importance for identifying potential targets of intervention, since advocating weight gain in childhood would not be recommended",medrxiv
Embryonic lymphocytes contribute to a genetic form of autoimmune inflammation,"Omenn Syndrome (OS) is a rare hematological disorder, caused by hypomorphic mutations in genes involved in B-/T-cell receptor (BCR/TCR) rearrangement that result in impaired lymphocyte development and immunodeficiency. Notwithstanding, few T-cell clones enriched in self-reactive specificities expand in peripheral tissues, where they trigger severe inflammation and autoimmune reactions. Interestingly, residual OS lymphocytes display characteristics proper of embryonic lymphocytes that emerge before, and independently from, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). This prompted us to hypothesize whether OS autoreactive T-cells are generated in the embryo independently from HSCs. Here we show that in the Rag2R229Q/R229Q OS mouse model, embryonic but not adult bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitors can generate T-cells. T-lymphopoiesis can be rescued in adult OS blood progenitors via their Lin28-mediated reprogramming to an embryonic-like state. Remarkably, when transplanted in immunodeficient mice, embryonic-like OS progenitors trigger tissue morphological alterations and inflammation in the large intestine of the recipients, recapitulating the typical OS inflammatory phenotype. Our study describes the previously unappreciated contribution of embryonic progenitors to the pool of autoreactive infilitrating T-cells, providing a novel platform for both the detailed study of human autoimmune disorders and the design of more targeted therapies",biorxiv
Performance of Publicly Available Large Language Models on Internal Medicine Board-style Questions,"Ongoing research attempts to benchmark large language models (LLM) against physicians' fund of knowledge by assessing LLM performance on medical examinations. No prior study has assessed LLM performance on internal medicine (IM) board examination questions. Limited data exists on how knowledge supplied to the models, derived from medical texts improves LLM performance. The performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4.0, LaMDA and Llama 2, with and without additional model input augmentation, was assessed on 240 randomly selected IM board-style questions. Questions were sourced from the Medical Knowledge Self-Assessment Program released by the American College of Physicians with each question serving as part of the LLM prompt. When available, LLMs were accessed both through their application programming interface (API) and their corresponding chatbot. Mode inputs were augmented with Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine using the method of Retrieval Augmented Generation. LLM-generated explanations to 25 correctly answered questions were presented in a blinded fashion alongside the MKSAP explanation to an IM board-certified physician tasked with selecting the human generated response. GPT-4.0, accessed either through Bing Chat or its API, scored 77.5-80.7% outperforming GPT-3.5, human respondents, LaMDA and Llama 2 in that order. GPT-4.0 outperformed human MKSAP users on every tested IM subject with its highest and lowest percentile scores in Infectious Disease (80th) and Rheumatology (99.7th), respectively. There is a 3.2-5.3% decrease in performance of both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.0 when accessing the LLM through its API instead of its online chatbot. There is 4.5-7.5% increase in performance of both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.0 accessed through their APIs after additional input augmentation. The blinded reviewer correctly identified the human generated MKSAP response in 72% of the 25-question sample set. GPT-4.0 performed best on IM board-style questions outperforming human respondents. Augmenting with domain-specific information improved performance rendering Retrieval Augmented Generation a possible technique for improving accuracy in medical examination LLM responses",PubMed
3D-bioprinted patient-specific organotypic bone model mimicking mineralization dysregulation in FKBP10-related osteogenesis imperfecta,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous group of rare genetic diseases characterized by increased bone fragility and deformities. The pathomechanisms of OI are poorly understood, hindering the development of disease-specific therapy. Addressing the limited understanding of OI and the lack of targeted treatments remains a challenge, given its varied symptoms and large clinical spectrum. Animal models have greatly advanced the understanding of the disease; however, the heterogeneity and subtype-specific symptoms are difficult to translate to humans. In vitro models offer a promising tool for translational medicine, as they have the potential to yield patient-specific insights in a controlled environment using patient derived-cells. We used mechanically loaded 3D-bioprinted patient-specific organotypic bone models and time-lapsed micro-computed tomography to demonstrate dysregulation of mineralization in FKBP10-related OI compared to healthy controls. In contrast to healthy controls, tissue mineral density and stiffness were decoupled, such that hypermineralization observed in OI samples did not lead to increased stiffness. Additionally, we were able to replicate experimental stiffness using sample specific micro-finite element analysis. This allowed us to show mineral formation in regions of high local strain, suggesting mechanoregulation in FKBP10-related OI organotypic bone models is comparable to healthy controls. Regional analysis of mineralization showed increased heterogeneous mineralization, microarchitectural inhomogeneities and scaffold microporosity of OI samples compared to healthy controls. Our results suggest that the observed dysregulation of mineralization is the main driver for the altered mineral-mechanics properties observed in FKBP10-related organotypic bone models.

"Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of bone age maturation during peri-pubertal growth in children with type I, III and IV osteogenesis imperfecta","Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)is a rare genetically heterogeneous disorder caused by changes in the expression or processing of type I collagen. Clinical manifestations include bone fragility, decreased linear growth, and skeletal deformities that vary in severity. In typically growing children, skeletal maturation proceeds in a predictable pattern of changes in the size, shape, and mineralization on the hand and wrist bones that can be followed radiographically known at the bone age. Assessment of bone age can be clinically used to assess time remaining for linear growth, and the onset and duration of puberty, both of which can be useful in determining the timing of some surgeries or the interpretation of other imaging modalities such as bone densitometry. Additionally, deviations in the expected maturation process of the bone age may prompt or assist in the work up of a significant delay or advancement in a child's growth pattern. The primary aim of our study was to determine whether the bone age in children with a skeletal disorder such as OI follow the same pattern and rate of bone maturation compared to a control population. Using participants from the Natural History Study of the Brittle Bone Disorders Consortium, we analyzed 159 left hand and wrist radiographs (bone age) for a cross-sectional analysis and 55 bone ages repeated at approximately 24 months for a longitudinal analysis of skeletal maturation. Bone ages were read by a pediatric endocrinologist and by an automated analysis using a program called BoneXpert. Our results demonstrated that in children with mild-to-moderate OI (types I and IV), the skeletal maturation is comparable to chronological age-mated controls. For those with more severe forms of OI (type III), there is a delayed pattern of skeletal maturation of less than a year (10.5 months CI 5.1-16) P = 0.0012) at baseline and a delayed rate of maturation over the two-year follow up compared to type I (P = 0.06) and type III (P = 0.02). However, despite these parameters being statistically different, they may not be clinically significant. We conclude the bone age, with careful interpretation, can be used in the OI population in a way that is similar to the general pediatric population",PubMed
Conserved Noncoding Cis-Elements Associated with Hibernation Modulate Metabolic and Behavioral Adaptations in Mice,"Our study elucidates functional roles for conserved cis-elements associated with the evolution of mammalian hibernation. Genomic analyses found topologically associated domains (TADs) that disproportionately accumulated convergent genomic changes in hibernators, including the TAD for the Fat Mass & Obesity (Fto) locus. Some hibernation-linked cis-elements in this TAD form regulatory contacts with multiple neighboring genes. Knockout mice for these cis-elements exhibit Fto, Irx3, and Irx5 gene expression changes, impacting hundreds of genes downstream. Profiles of pre-torpor, torpor, and post-torpor phenotypes found distinct roles for each cis-element in metabolic control, while a high caloric diet uncovered different obesogenic effects. One cis-element promoting a lean phenotype influences foraging behaviors throughout life, affecting specific behavioral sequences. Thus, convergent evolution in hibernators pinpoints functional genetic mechanisms of mammalian metabolic control.  One-sentence summaryDeletions of conserved cis-elements tied to hibernator evolution causes diverse metabolic traits in mice",biorxiv
Does bisphenol A (BPA) participates in the pathogenesis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)?,"PCOS is an endocrine disorder characterized by chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries. Its etiology is uncertain. It is debated whether BPA would be a component of the environmental factor in the etiology of PCOS. Contamination by BPA can occur from food packaging (exposure during the diet) and through skin absorption and/or inhalation. It can be transferred to the fetus via the placenta or to the infant via breast milk, and it can be found in follicular fluid, fetal serum, and amniotic fluid. The phenolic structure of BPA allows it to interact with Estrogen Receptors (ERs) through genomic signaling, in which BPA binds to nuclear ERα or Erβ, or through nongenomic signaling by binding to membrane ERs, prompting a rapid and intense response. With daily and constant exposure, BPA's tendency to bioaccumulate and its ability to activate nongenomic signaling pathways can alter women's metabolic and reproductive function, leading to hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, chronic inflammatory state, and anovulation and favoring PCOS. The harmful changes caused by BPA can be passed on to future generations without the need for additional exposure because of epigenetic modifications. Not only high BPA levels can produce harmful effects, but at low levels, BPA may be harmful when exposure occurs during the most vulnerable periods, such as the fetal and neonatal periods, as well as during the prepubertal age causing an early accumulation of BPA in the body. Learning how BPA participates in the pathogenesis of PCOS poses a challenge and further studies should be conducted",PubMed
Defective Homologous Recombination and Genomic Instability Predict Increased Responsiveness to Carbon Ion Radiotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is inherently resistant to conventional chemo-and radiation-therapy. However, clinical trials showed that carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) with concurrent gemcitabine can be effective for treating unresectable locally advanced PDAC. In this study, we aimed to determine features that could identify patients who would benefit most from CIRT. A panel of human PDAC cell lines with various genetic backgrounds was leveraged to determine whether a subset could be identified that preferentially responds to CIRT. The cell lines displayed a differential response to CIRT as compared to {gamma}-rays as measured by relative biological effectiveness (RBE) calculated at 10% survival, which ranged from 1.96 to 3.04. Increased radiosensitivity correlated with decreased DNA double strand break (DSB) repair as measured by {gamma}H2AX foci resolution. We determined that the cell lines most sensitive to CIRT are defective in the homologous recombination (HR) DSB repair pathway and/or have high genomic instability due to elevated replication stress. Next, this knowledge was utilized to assess whether the HR pathway could be targeted to potentiate CIRT in vitro. It was determined that pretreating a radioresistant PDAC cell line with the HR inhibitor, B02, resulted in a marked increase in sensitivity to CIRT when treated with high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation in the spread-out Bragg peak (74.1-89.3 keV/m) but not at the entry LET (13.0-16.4 keV/m) in vitro as opposed to that seen with a NHEJ inhibitor. These data suggest a greater therapeutic index with the combination therapy in the tumor over normal tissues based on LET distribution. These data support the notion that PDAC tumors with defects in HR and/or those with high inherent replication stress respond to CIRT without the concern for excessive normal tissue toxicity. With the advent of agents targeting HR, the difference in tumor cell response in the entry region vs within the SOBP based upon the respective LETs of those regions of the beam profile, will be superior to agents that target NHEJ",biorxiv
Genomics transformer for diagnosing Parkinson's disease,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and presents a complex etiology with genomic and environmental factors and no recognized cures. Genotype data, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), could be used as a prodromal factor for early detection of PD. However, the polygenic nature of PD presents a challenge as the complex relationships between SNPs towards disease development are difficult to model. Traditional assessment methods such as polygenic risk scores and machine learning approaches struggle to capture the complex interactions present in the genotype data, thus limiting their discriminative capabilities in diagnosis. On the other hand, deep learning models are better suited for this task. Nevertheless, they encounter difficulties of their own such as a lack of interpretability. To overcome these limitations, in this work, a novel transformer encoder-based model is introduced to classify PD patients from healthy controls based on their genotype. This method is designed to effectively model complex global feature interactions and enable increased interpretability through the learned attention scores. The proposed framework outperformed traditional machine learning models and multilayer perceptron (MLP) baseline models. Moreover, visualization of the learned SNP-SNP associations provides not only interpretability to the model but also valuable insights into the biochemical pathways underlying PD development, which are corroborated by pathway enrichment analysis. Our results suggest novel SNP interactions to be further studied in wet lab and clinical settings",PubMed
Weakly Supervised Classification for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma with Transformer in Whole Slide Images,"Pathological examination of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an indispensable factor for diagnosis, guiding clinical treatment and judging prognosis. Traditional and fully supervised NPC diagnosis algorithms require manual delineation of regions of interest on the gigapixel of whole slide images (WSIs), which however is laborious and often biased. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised framework based on Tokens-to-Token Vision Transformer (WS-T2T-ViT) for accurate NPC classification with only a slide-level label. The label of tile images is inherited from their slide-level label. Specifically, WS-T2T-ViT is composed of the multi-resolution pyramid, T2T-ViT and multi-scale attention module. The multi-resolution pyramid is designed for imitating the coarse-to-fine process of manual pathological analysis to learn features from different magnification levels. The T2T module captures the local and global features to overcome the lack of global information. The multi-scale attention module improves classification performance by weighting the contributions of different granularity levels. Extensive experiments are performed on the 802-patient NPC and CAMELYON16 dataset. WS-T2T-ViT achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.989 for NPC classification on the NPC dataset. The experiment results of CAMELYON16 dataset demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of WS-T2T-ViT in WSI-level classification",PubMed
Artificial intelligence-generated patient information leaflets: a comparison of contents according to British Association of Dermatologists standards,"Patient information leaflets (PILs) can supplement a clinical consultation and provide additional information for a patient to read in their own time. A wide range of PILs are available for distribution by the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) and undergo rigorous review ahead of publication. In the UK, 7.1 million adults are estimated to have the reading age of a 9-year-old child and 43% are unable to comprehend written health information. To determine whether artificial intelligence (AI) can produce PILs that include a similar degree of content to current BAD PILs. Using the AI tool ChatGPT, 10 PILs were generated, and their contents compared with those of existing BAD PILs using an author-generated list of commonly included themes. Omissions were noted and a repeat series of PILs generated using targeted request phrasing. The readability of AI-generated PILs was also analysed. AI-generated PILs were found to include similar factual content to BAD PILs but excluded information that was felt to be more pertinent to patient concerns such as curability and heritability. Targeted request phrasing saw AI generate PILs including this content. The readability of AI-generated PILs was beyond that of a large number of UK adults. Where a condition-specific PIL is not readily available, an AI-generated PIL can provide relevant information of lesser quality than existing BAD PILs, which may be inaccessible to some patients. Specific caution is advised regarding AI-generated medication-specific PILs",PubMed
Computer-assisted patient identification tool in inborn errors of metabolism - potential for rare disease patient registry and big data analysis,"Patient registries are crucial for rare disease management. However, manual registry construction is labor-intensive and often not user-friendly. Our goal is to establish Hong Kong's first computer-assisted patient identification tool for rare diseases, starting with inborn errors of metabolism (IEM). Patient data from 2010 to 2019 was retrieved from electronic databases. Through big data analytics, patient data were filtered based on specific IEM-related biochemical and genetic tests. Clinical notes were analyzed using a rule-based natural language processing technique called regular expression. The algorithm classified each extracted paragraph as ""IEM-related"" or ""not IEM-related."" Pathologists reviewed the paragraphs for curation, and the algorithm's performance was evaluated. Out of 46,419 patients with IEM-related tests, the algorithm identified 100 as ""IEM-related."" After pathologists' validation, 96 cases were confirmed as true IEM, with 1 uncertain case and 3 false positives. A secondary ascertainment yielded a sensitivity of 92.3% compared to our previously published IEM cohort. Our artificial intelligence approach provides a novel method to identify IEM patients, facilitating the creation of a centralized, computer-assisted rare disease patient registry at the local and national levels. This data can potentially be accessed by multiple stakeholders for collaborative research and to enhance healthcare management for rare diseases",PubMed
Discovery of genomic and transcriptomic pleiotropy between kidney function and soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products using correlated meta-analyses: The Long Life Family Study (LLFS),"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have increased oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, which may escalate the production of advanced glycation end-products (AGE). High soluble receptor for AGE (sRAGE) and low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels are associated with CKD and aging. We evaluated whether eGFR calculated from creatinine and cystatin C share pleiotropic genetic factors with sRAGE. We employed whole-genome sequencing and correlated meta-analyses on combined genomewide association study (GWAS) p-values in 4,182 individuals (age range: 24-110) from the Long Life Family Study (LLFS). We also conducted transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) on whole blood in a subset of 1,209 individuals. We identified 59 pleiotropic GWAS loci (p<5x10-8) and 17 TWAS genes (Bonferroni-p<2.73x10-6) for eGFR traits and sRAGE. TWAS genes, LSP1 and MIR23AHG, were associated with eGFR and sRAGE located within GWAS loci, lncRNA-KCNQ1OT1 and CACNA1A/CCDC130, respectively. GWAS variants were eQTLs in the kidney glomeruli and tubules, and GWAS genes predicted kidney carcinoma. TWAS genes harbored eQTLs in the kidney, predicted kidney carcinoma, and connected enhancer-promoter variants with kidney function-related phenotypes at p<5x10-8. Additionally, higher allele frequencies of protective variants for eGFR traits were detected in LLFS than in ALFA-Europeans and TOPMed, suggesting better kidney function in healthy-aging LLFS than in general populations. Integrating genomic annotation and transcriptional gene activity revealed the enrichment of genetic elements in kidney function and kidney diseases. The identified pleiotropic loci and gene expressions for eGFR and sRAGE suggest their underlying shared genetic effects and highlight their roles in kidney- and aging-related signaling pathways",medrxiv
Type 2 Diabetes risk alleles in Peptidyl-glycine Alpha-amidating Monooxygenase influence GLP-1 levels and response to GLP-1 Receptor Agonists,"Patients with type 2 diabetes vary in their response to currently available therapeutic agents (including GLP-1 receptor agonists) leading to suboptimal glycemic control and increased risk of complications. We show that human carriers of hypomorphic T2D-risk alleles in the gene encoding peptidyl-glycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), as well as Pam-knockout mice, display increased resistance to GLP-1 in vivo. Pam inactivation in mice leads to reduced gastric GLP-1R expression and faster gastric emptying: this persists during GLP-1R agonist treatment and is rescued when GLP-1R activity is antagonized, indicating resistance to GLP-1s gastric slowing properties. Meta-analysis of human data from studies examining GLP-1R agonist response (including RCTs) reveals a relative loss of 44% and 20% of glucose lowering (measured by glycated hemoglobin) in individuals with hypomorphic PAM alleles p.S539W and p.D536G treated with GLP-1R agonist. Genetic variation in PAM has effects on incretin signaling that alters response to medication used commonly for treatment of T2D.  (Funded by the Wellcome, Medical Research Council, European Union, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, United Kingdom, Registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02723110.)  Summary ParagraphType 2 diabetes (T2D) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally1. Current management of T2D patients focuses on lowering glycemic exposure and reducing complications with lifestyle and pharmacological interventions2. Despite the availability of multiple medications to lower glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), only 53% of individuals with T2D reach the glycemic target (HbA1c <7%)3, 4. There is potential to improve medication selection through ""precision medicine"" where patient specific factors (e.g. genetic markers) are used to indicate whether a patient is more or less likely to respond to a medication. Here we show that human carriers of hypomorphic T2D-risk alleles in the gene encoding peptidyl-glycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), as well as Pam-knockout mice, have reduced PAM enzyme activity, display increased resistance to glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in vivo and have reduced response to the GLP-1 receptor agonist. Meta-analysis of human data from studies examining GLP-1 receptor agonist response (including RCTs) reveals a relative loss of 44% and 20% of glucose lowering (measured by glycated hemoglobin) in individuals with hypomorphic PAM alleles p.S539W and p.D536G treated with GLP-1 receptor agonist.

Preclinical Pediatric Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH),"Pediatric solid tumors arise from diverse tissues during development and exhibit a wide range of molecular, cellular and genetic features. This diversity, combined with the low incidence of pediatric cancer makes it increasingly difficult to personalize therapy for individual patients based on the unique features of their tumors. Therefore, well-credentialed preclinical models that capture the diversity and heterogeneity of pediatric solid tumors are essential for identifying molecular targeted therapeutics for precision medicine. Here, we report 281 orthotopic patient derived xenografts (O-PDXs) from 224 patients representing 24 different types of pediatric solid tumors. We have performed genomic characterization of the O-PDXs and compared them to their corresponding patient tumors. To demonstrate the feasibility and utility of using such a diverse collection of O-PDXs in preclinical studies, we performed a preclinical pediatric precision medicine trial based on the NCI-COG Pediatric MATCH trial enrollment criteria. We also tested molecular targeted therapy for a novel oncogenic fusion recently reported in pediatric melanoma and precision drug delivery using nano-liposomal irinotecan. Our studies demonstrate the value of large, well-credentialed preclinical models for future precision medicine in pediatric oncology using single agents, drug combinations and novel drug formulations.  Translational RelevanceThis study demonstrates the value of utilizing fully characterized preclinical models of pediatric solid tumors to evaluate the response to precision medicine approaches. Our results demonstrate the importance of performing comprehensive preclinical testing using multiple orthotopic patient derived xenografts to validate and prioritize vulnerabilities identified through genomic or integrated analyses which can be translated into clinical trials. Importantly, this study identified combinations using nano-liposomal irinotecan in a precision drug delivery approach that may benefit pediatric solid tumor patients. In addition, all models and their associated data are made freely available to the scientific community through the Childhood Solid Tumor Network",biorxiv
Classification of clinically actionable genetic mutations in cancer patients,"Personalized medicine in cancer treatment aims to treat each individual's cancer tumor uniquely based on the genetic sequence of the cancer patient and is a much more effective approach compared to traditional methods which involve treating each type of cancer in the same, generic manner. However, personalized treatment requires the classification of cancer-related genes once profiled, which is a highly labor-intensive and time-consuming task for pathologists making the adoption of personalized medicine a slow progress worldwide. In this paper, we propose an intelligent multi-class classifier system that uses a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning algorithms to automatically classify clinically actionable genetic mutations using evidence from text-based medical literature. The training data set for the classifier was obtained from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the Random Forest algorithm was applied with TF-IDF for feature extraction and truncated SVD for dimensionality reduction. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the previous research in terms of accuracy and precision scores, giving an accuracy score of approximately 82%. The system has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment and lead to significant improvements in cancer therapy",PubMed
CPMKG: a condition-based knowledge graph for precision medicine,"Personalized medicine tailors treatments and dosages based on a patient's unique characteristics, particularly its genetic profile. Over the decades, stratified research and clinical trials have uncovered crucial drug-related information-such as dosage, effectiveness, and side effects-affecting specific individuals with particular genetic backgrounds. This genetic-specific knowledge, characterized by complex multirelationships and conditions, cannot be adequately represented or stored in conventional knowledge systems. To address these challenges, we developed CPMKG, a condition-based platform that enables comprehensive knowledge representation. Through information extraction and meticulous curation, we compiled 307 614 knowledge entries, encompassing thousands of drugs, diseases, phenotypes (complications/side effects), genes, and genomic variations across four key categories: drug side effects, drug sensitivity, drug mechanisms, and drug indications. CPMKG facilitates drug-centric exploration and enables condition-based multiknowledge inference, accelerating knowledge discovery through three pivotal applications. To enhance user experience, we seamlessly integrated a sophisticated large language model that provides textual interpretations for each subgraph, bridging the gap between structured graphs and language expressions. With its comprehensive knowledge graph and user-centric applications, CPMKG serves as a valuable resource for clinical research, offering drug information tailored to personalized genetic profiles, syndromes, and phenotypes.

PGxQA: A Resource for Evaluating LLM Performance for Pharmacogenomic QA Tasks,"Pharmacogenetics represents one of the most promising areas of precision medicine, with several guidelines for genetics-guided treatment ready for clinical use. Despite this, implementation has been slow, with few health systems incorporating the technology into their standard of care. One major barrier to uptake is the lack of education and awareness of pharmacogenetics among clinicians and patients. The introduction of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 has raised the possibility of medical chatbots that deliver timely information to clinicians, patients, and researchers with a simple interface. Although state-of-the-art LLMs have shown impressive performance at advanced tasks like medical licensing exams, in practice they still often provide false information, which is particularly hazardous in a clinical context. To quantify the extent of this issue, we developed a series of automated and expert-scored tests to evaluate the performance of chatbots in answering pharmacogenetics questions from the perspective of clinicians, patients, and researchers. We applied this benchmark to state-of-the-art LLMs and found that newer models like GPT-4o greatly outperform their predecessors, but still fall short of the standards required for clinical use. Our benchmark will be a valuable public resource for subsequent developments in this space as we work towards better clinical AI for pharmacogenetics",PubMed
Assessing the Utility of Large Language Models for Phenotype-Driven Gene Prioritization in Rare Genetic Disorder Diagnosis,"Phenotype-driven gene prioritization is a critical process in the diagnosis of rare genetic disorders for identifying and ranking potential disease-causing genes based on observed physical traits or phenotypes. While traditional approaches rely on curated knowledge graphs with phenotype-gene relations, recent advancements in large language models have opened doors to the potential of AI predictions through extensive training on diverse corpora and complex models. This study conducted a comprehensive evaluation of five large language models, including two Generative Pre-trained Transformers series, and three Llama2 series, assessing their performance across three key metrics: task completeness, gene prediction accuracy, and adherence to required output structures. Various experiments explored combinations of models, prompts, input types, and task difficulty levels. Our findings reveal that even the best-performing LLM, GPT-4, achieved an accuracy of 16.0%, which still lags behind traditional bioinformatics tools. Prediction accuracy increased with the parameter/model size. A similar increasing trend was observed for the task completion rate, with complicated prompts more likely to increase task completeness in models smaller than GPT-4. However, complicated prompts are more likely to decrease the structure compliance rate, but no prompt effects on GPT-4. Compared to HPO term-based input, LLM was also able to achieve better than random prediction accuracy by taking free-text input, but slightly lower than with the HPO input. Bias analysis showed that certain genes, such as MECP2, CDKL5, and SCN1A, are more likely to be top-ranked, potentially explaining the variances observed across different datasets. This study provides valuable insights into the integration of LLMs within genomic analysis, contributing to the ongoing discussion on the utilization of advanced LLMs in clinical workflows","PubMed,arXiv"
Assessing the utility of large language models for phenotype-driven gene prioritization in the diagnosis of rare genetic disease,"Phenotype-driven gene prioritization is fundamental to diagnosing rare genetic disorders. While traditional approaches rely on curated knowledge graphs with phenotype-gene relations, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) promise a streamlined text-to-gene solution. In this study, we evaluated five LLMs, including two generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) series and three Llama2 series, assessing their performance across task completeness, gene prediction accuracy, and adherence to required output structures. We conducted experiments, exploring various combinations of models, prompts, phenotypic input types, and task difficulty levels. Our findings revealed that the best-performed LLM, GPT-4, achieved an average accuracy of 17.0% in identifying diagnosed genes within the top 50 predictions, which still falls behind traditional tools. However, accuracy increased with the model size. Consistent results were observed over time, as shown in the dataset curated after 2023. Advanced techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and few-shot learning did not improve the accuracy. Sophisticated prompts were more likely to enhance task completeness, especially in smaller models. Conversely, complicated prompts tended to decrease output structure compliance rate. LLMs also achieved better-than-random prediction accuracy with free-text input, though performance was slightly lower than with standardized concept input. Bias analysis showed that highly cited genes, such as BRCA1, TP53, and PTEN, are more likely to be predicted. Our study provides valuable insights into integrating LLMs with genomic analysis, contributing to the ongoing discussion on their utilization in clinical workflows",PubMed
Beyond neuropsychological tests: AI speech analysis in PKU,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by toxic phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations in blood and brain. State-of-the-art analyses of speech detected a dimension of verbal discourse providing insights that extend beyond those captured by existing paradigms to measure performance associated with biochemical markers in PKU. The Cookie Theft Picture Task provided a standardized stimulus for eliciting spontaneous speech from 42 adults with PKU and 41 adults without PKU. Subtests measuring language and memory from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition showed no differences between the groups and no correlations with biomarkers in PKU. In contrast, AI analyses of responses to the Cookie Theft Task revealed significant differences between the PKU and non-PKU groups on 23 linguistic features. Using multidimensional scaling (MDS), these features were aggregated into a single quantifiable Dimension 1 that significantly correlated with biomarkers. When extreme examples of Dimension 1 were presented to chatGPT, the differences noted reflected attention to detail, clarity in word choice, expression cohesion, contextual awareness and emotion recognition. We subsequently defined Dimension 1 as Proficiency in Verbal Discourse. This novel measure elucidated discourse styles possibly associated with suboptimal achievement and learning disabilities, often reported in PKU. In summary, AI captured a characteristic associated with metabolic status undetectable through traditional neuropsychological measures. Future studies will expand upon this novel paradigm, leveraging speech AI to quantify meaningful aspects of everyday functioning and possibly provide information for management decisions. Once validated, this measure holds promise for extension to other rare diseases and incorporation into clinical trials",PubMed
An Unusual Case of Pheochromocytoma Associated with von Hippel-Lindau Disease and Lynch Syndrome During Pregnancy,"Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) and/or paragangliomas (PGLs) are a challenge to diagnose during pregnancy because of elusive signs and testing difficulties. We report a 25-year-old woman with no pertinent medical history who presented to the hospital with hypertension, vision loss, and weakness and was initially diagnosed with preeclampsia. Imaging showed hemangioblastomas in the medulla and thoracic spine, pancreatic cysts, and a renal cyst. The endocrinology service was consulted for possible PCCs associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL). Serum and urine normetanephrine levels were elevated despite the lack of overt PCCs/PGLs seen on magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography. The patient was medically managed with doxazosin and then labetalol. Despite successful resection of the hemangioblastoma in the medulla, the patient suffered respiratory distress requiring tracheostomy and venous-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) and fetal demise. After 3 months, the patient was discharged to rehabilitation. Follow-up genetics were heterozygous for VHL and Lynch syndrome. DOTATATE positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan showed a small hepatic focus of a maximum standard uptake value of 12.1. Altogether, this case illustrates the importance of prompt diagnosis and proper management of PCCs/PGLs during pregnancy and incorporating genetic information during surveillance to lower morbidity and mortality",PubMed
Personalized oncology in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas: integrating genetic analysis with machine learning,"Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PCCs/PGLs) are uncommon neuroendocrine tumors with a significant genetic tendency. Approximately 35-40% of these tumors are associated with genetic factors. The present study performed a thorough analysis using publicly accessible genetic and clinical data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to examine the involvement of six genes, namely GBP1, KIF13B, GPT, CSDE1, CEP164, and CLCA1, in the development of PCCs/PGLs. By employing multi-omics data, this study investigates the relationship between mutational patterns and the prognosis of tumors, focusing on the possibility of tailoring treatment methods to individual patients. The study utilizes Mutect2 to detect somatic mutations with high confidence in whole-exome sequencing data from PCCG samples. The study uncovers mild effects on protein function caused by particular mutations, including GBP1 (p.Cys12Tyr), KIF13B (p.Arg847Gly), and GPT (p.Gln50Arg). A random forest classifier uses mutational profiles to predict potential drug recommendations, proposing a focused therapy strategy. This study thoroughly analyzes the genetic mutations found in PCCs/PGLs, highlighting the significance of precision medicine in developing specific treatments for these uncommon types of cancer. This study aims to improve the understanding of the development of tumors and identify personalized treatment approaches by combining genetic data with machine learning analyses",PubMed
Differential expression ofCCD4(4B) drives natural variation in fruit carotenoidcontent in strawberry ( Fragaria spp.),"Pigments, mainly anthocyanins and carotenoids, are important contributors to fruits visual appearance and nutritional properties. In strawberry (Fragaria spp.), the genetic and molecular mechanisms regulating fruit carotenoid biosynthesis and its natural variation remain largely unexplored. In this study, we sought to identify genomic loci contributing to variation in yellow flesh pigmentation. A major QTL, qYellow Flesh-4B, accounting for 82% of the total phenotypic variation was identified on F. x ananassa chromosome 4B. Following a candidate gene approach, we determined that CCD4(4B), a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD), was the underlying gene. Specific polymorphisms on CCD4(4B) promoter region were associated with the yellow flesh phenotype and with differential regulation of CCD4(4B) expression during fruit ripening. Furthermore, CCD4(4B) expression levels were negatively correlated with violaxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, {beta}-carotene and total carotenoid content. The role of CCD4(4B) in carotenoid turnover was confirmed by transient overexpression in F. x ananassa fruits, which led to a decrease in carotenoid accumulation. Notably, a -35 C>T SNP identified in CCD4(4B) promoter was found to be predictive for CCD4(4B) expression, and carotenoid content in fruits of a diverse germplasm collection, which included different octoploid Fragaria species. Taken together, these results provide important genetic insights into the natural variation of carotenoid content in strawberry. The High-Resolution Melting (HRM) DNA test here developed offers a fast and reliable method to predict high fruit carotenoid content, representing a useful tool for breeding projects aiming to enhance the nutritional value of this crop",biorxiv
Diagnosis and management of pituitary adenomas in children and adolescents,"Pituitary adenomas (PAs)-also now called pituitary neuroendocrine tumours or Pit-NETS-are rare in children and adolescents and exceptional below the age of 10. Most evidence-based high-quality data are derived from larger studies in adult patients. We will review recent knowledge on the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment modalities of the different types of pituitary adenomas diagnosed in children and adolescents, emphasizing the many reasons why these cases should be discussed within pituitary-specific multidisciplinary teams with experts from both paediatric and adult practice. Paediatric PA presents multiple peculiarities that may challenge their adequate management. They are overall proportionally larger and more aggressive than in adults, with potential mass effects including hypopituitarism. Hormonal hypersecretion is frequent, resulting in clinical syndromes affecting normal growth and pubertal development. Prolactinomas represent the most frequent subtype of PA found during childhood, followed by adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and growth hormone (GH)-secreting adenomas, while clinically non-functioning adenomas are exceptionally diagnosed before the age of 16. The occurrence of a pituitary tumour in a young individual should also prompt genetic testing in each case, searching for either germline mutations in one of the known genes that may drive inherited/familial PA (such as the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 or MEN1 gene, or the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein or AIP gene), or for a mosaic activating mutation of GNAS as found in the McCune-Albright syndrome",PubMed
Plasmid-encoded insertion sequences promote rapid adaptation in clinical enterobacteria,"Plasmids are extrachromosomal genetic elements commonly found in bacteria. Plasmids are known to fuel bacterial evolution through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), but recent analyses indicate that they can also promote intragenomic adaptations. However, the role of plasmids as catalysts of bacterial evolution beyond HGT remains poorly explored. In this study, we investigate the impact of a widespread conjugative plasmid, pOXA-48, on the evolution of various multidrug-resistant clinical enterobacteria. Combining experimental and within-patient evolution analyses, we unveil that plasmid pOXA-48 promotes bacterial evolution through the transposition of plasmid-encoded insertion sequence 1 (IS1) elements. Specifically, IS1-mediated gene inactivations expedite the adaptation rate of clinical strains in vitro and foster within-patient adaptation in the gut microbiota. We decipher the mechanism underlying the plasmid-mediated surge in IS1 transposition, revealing a negative feedback loop regulated by the genomic copy number of IS1. Given the overrepresentation of IS elements in bacterial plasmids, our findings propose that plasmid-mediated IS transposition represents a crucial mechanism for swift bacterial adaptation",biorxiv
Congenital pleuropulmonary blastoma in a newborn with a variant of uncertain significance in DICER1 evaluated by RNA-sequencing,"Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is a rare mesenchymal malignancy of the lung and is the most common pulmonary malignancy in infants and children. Cystic PPB, the earliest form of PPB occurring from birth to approximately two years of age, is often mistaken for a congenital pulmonary airway malformation, as the two entities can be difficult to distinguish on imaging and pathology. Diagnosis of PPB should prompt workup for DICER1 syndrome, an autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome. We report a newborn with a congenital PPB presenting with tachypnea and hypoxia, who was found to have variant of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) in DICER1. A term female infant developed respiratory distress shortly after birth. Initial imaging was concerning for a congenital pulmonary airway malformation versus congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and she was transferred to a quaternary neonatal intensive care unit for management and workup. Chest CT angiography demonstrated a macrocytic multicystic lesion within the right lower lobe without systemic arterial supply. The pediatric surgery team was consulted, and the neonate underwent right lower lobectomy. Pathology revealed a type I PPB. Oncology and genetics consultants recommended observation without chemotherapy and single gene sequencing of DICER1, which identified a germline VUS in DICER1 predicted to alter splicing. RNA-sequencing from blood demonstrated that the variant resulted in an in-frame deletion of 29 amino acids in a majority of transcripts from the affected allele. Due to the patient's young age at presentation and high clinical suspicion for DICER1 syndrome, tumor surveillance was initiated. Renal and pelvic ultrasonography were unremarkable. We present the case of a term neonate with respiratory distress and cystic lung mass, found to have a type I PPB with a germline VUS in DICER1 that likely increased her risk of DICER1-related tumors. Nearly 70% of patients with PPB demonstrate germline mutations in DICER1. Review of RNA sequencing data demonstrates the difficulty in classifying splice variants such as this. Penetrance is low, and many patients with pathogenic DICER1 variants do not develop a malignancy. Best practice surgical and oncologic recommendations include an individualized approach and tumor board discussion. This case highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary team approach and the utility of international registries for patients with rare diagnoses",PubMed
How to improve polygenic prediction from whole-genome sequencing data by leveraging predicted epigenomic features?,"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are crucial in genetics for predicting individual susceptibility to complex diseases by aggregating the effects of numerous genetic variants. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized our ability to detect rare and even de novo variants, creating an exciting opportunity for developing new PRS methods that can effectively leverage rare variants and capture the complex relationships among different variants. Furthermore, regulatory mechanisms play a crucial role in gene expression and disease manifestation, offering avenues to further enhance the performance and interpretation of PRS predictions. Through simulation studies, we highlighted aspects where current PRS methods face challenges when applied to WGS data, aiming to shed light on potential opportunities for further improvement. To address these challenges, we developed Epi-PRS, an approach that leverages the power of genomic large language models (LLM) to impute epigenomic signals across diverse cellular contexts, for use as intermediate variables between genotype and phenotype. A pretrained LLM is employed to transform genotypes into epigenomic signals using personal diploid sequences as inputs, and the genetic risk is then estimated based on the imputed personal epigenomic signals. Epi-PRS enhances the assessment of personal variant impacts, enabling a comprehensive and holistic consideration of genotypic and regulatory information within large genomic regions. Our simulation results demonstrated that incorporating the nuanced effects of non-linear models, rare variants, and regulatory information can provide more precise PRS prediction and better understanding of genetic risk. Applying Epi-PRS to real data from the UK Biobank, our results further showed that Epi-PRS significantly outperforms existing PRS methods in two major diseases: breast cancer and diabetes. This study suggests that PRS methods can benefit from incorporating non-linear models, rare variants, and regulatory information, highlighting the potential for significant advancements in disease risk modeling and enhancing the understanding of precision medicine.  Significance StatementEpi-PRS improves polygenic risk scoring by integrating genomic large language models (LLMs) to impute epigenomic signals as intermediaries between genotype and phenotype. This approach enables a more comprehensive assessment of personal variant impacts by incorporating non-linear models, rare variants, and regulatory mechanisms. By leveraging the power of genomic LLM trained on massive amount of reference epigenomics data, Epi-PRS has demonstrated superior performance over existing PRS methods in predicting genetic risk for breast cancer and diabetes in UK Biobank data. These results highlight the potential of Epi-PRS to improve disease risk modeling and advance the field of precision medicine",medrxiv
An Expert-guided Hierarchical Graph Attention Network for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Highlyassociative Genetic Biomarkers Identification,"Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a common debilitating mental disorder, that occurs in some individuals following extremely traumatic events. Traditional identification of Genetic Markers (GM) for PTSD is mainly based on a statistical clinical approach by comparing PTSD patients with normal controls. However, these statistical studies present limitations, often generating inconsistent results. Few studies have yet examined thoroughly the role of somatic mutations, PTSD disease pathways and their relationships. Capitalizing on deep learning techniques, we have developed a novel hierarchical graph attention network to identify highly correlational GM (HGMs) of PTSD. The network presents the following novelties: First, both a hierarchical graph structure and a graph attention mechanism have been integrated into a model to develop a graph attention network (GAtN) model. Second, domain-specific knowledge, including somatic mutations, genes, PTSD pathways and their correlations have been incorporated into the graph structures. Third, 12 somatic mutations having high or moderate impacts on proteins or genes have been identified as the potential HGMs for PTSD. Fourth, our study is carefully guided by prominent PTSD literature or clinical experts of the field; any high saliency HGMs generated from our model are further verified by existing PTSD-related authoritative medical journals. Our study illustrates the utility and significance of a hybrid approach, integrating both AI and expert-guided/domain-specific knowledge for thorough identification of biomarkers of PTSD, while building on the nature of convergence and divergence of PTSD pathways. Our expert-guided AI-driven methodology can be extended to other pathological-based HGM identification studies; it will transform the methodology of biomarker identification for different life-threatening diseases to speed up the complex lengthy procedures of new biomarkers identification",medrxiv
Postoperative Delirium and the Older Adult: Untangling the Confusion,"Postoperative delirium is one of the most prevalent postoperative complications, affecting mostly older adults. Its incidence is expected to rise because of surgical advances, shifting demographics, and increased life expectancy. Although an acute alteration in brain function, postoperative delirium is associated with adverse outcomes, including progressive cognitive decline and dementia, that place significant burdens on patients' lives and healthcare systems. This has prompted efforts to understand the mechanisms of postoperative delirium to provide effective prevention and treatment. There are multiple mechanisms involved in the etiology of postoperative delirium that share similarities with the physiological changes associated with the aging brain. In addition, older patients often have multiple comorbidities including increased cognitive impairment that is also implicated in the genesis of delirium. These tangled connections pinpointed a shift toward creation of a holistic model of the pathophysiology of postoperative delirium. Scientific advancements integrating clinical risk factors, possible postoperative delirium biomarkers, genetic features, digital platforms, and other biotechnical and information technological innovations, will become available in the near future. Advances in artificial intelligence, for example, will aggregate cognitive testing platforms with patient-specific postoperative delirium risk stratification studies, panels of serum and cerebrospinal fluid molecules, electroencephalogram signatures, and gut microbiome features, along with the integration of novel polygenetic variants of sleep and cognition. These advances will allow for the enrollment of high-risk patients into prevention programs and help uncover new pharmacologic targets",PubMed
Investigation of a Novel Mouse Model of Prader-Willi Syndrome with Invalidation of Necdin and Magel2,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multigenic disorder caused by the loss of seven contiguous paternally expressed genes. Mouse models with inactivation of all PWS genes are lethal. Knockout (KO) mouse models for each candidate gene were generated, but they lack the functional interactions between PWS genes. Here, we revealed an interplay between Necdin and Magel2 ""PWS"" genes and generated a novel mouse model (named ""Madin"") with a deletion including both genes. A subset of Madin KO mice showed neonatal lethality. Behaviorally, surviving mutant mice exhibited sensory delays during infancy and alterations in social exploration at adulthood. Madin KO mice had a lower body weight before weaning, persisting after weaning in males only, with reduced fat mass and improved glucose tolerance. Delayed sexual maturation and altered timing of puberty onset were observed in mutant mice. Adult Madin KO mice displayed increased ventilation and a persistent increase in apneas following a hypercapnic challenge. Transcriptomics analyses revealed a dysregulation of key circadian genes and alterations of genes associated with axonal function that were also found in the hypothalamus of patients with PWS. At neuroanatomical levels, we report an impaired maturation of oxytocin neurons and a disrupted development of melanocortin circuits. Together, these data indicate that the Madin KO mouse is a reliable and more genetically relevant model for the study of PWS",biorxiv
Central precocious puberty in Prader-Willi syndrome: a narrative review,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS, OMIM176270) is a rare genetic disorder with recognizable dysmorphic features and multisystemic consequences such as endocrine, neurocognitive and metabolic ones. Although most patients with Prader-Willi syndrome exhibit hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, there is variability regarding sexual maturation, with precocious puberty occurring in rare cases. Our aim is to elaborate a thorough review of Prader-Willi patients with central precocious puberty, in order to raise awareness of such cases and to enhance our knowledge regarding the diagnosis and prompt treatment of this particular PWS patients",PubMed
GP-GPT: Large Language Model for Gene-Phenotype Mapping,"Pre-trained large language models(LLMs) have attracted increasing attention in biomedical domains due to their success in natural language processing. However, the complex traits and heterogeneity of multi-sources genomics data pose significant challenges when adapting these models to the bioinformatics and biomedical field. To address these challenges, we present GP-GPT, the first specialized large language model for genetic-phenotype knowledge representation and genomics relation analysis. Our model is fine-tuned in two stages on a comprehensive corpus composed of over 3,000,000 terms in genomics, proteomics, and medical genetics, derived from multiple large-scale validated datasets and scientific publications. GP-GPT demonstrates proficiency in accurately retrieving medical genetics information and performing common genomics analysis tasks, such as genomics information retrieval and relationship determination. Comparative experiments across domain-specific tasks reveal that GP-GPT outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs, including Llama2, Llama3 and GPT-4. These results highlight GP-GPT's potential to enhance genetic disease relation research and facilitate accurate and efficient analysis in the fields of genomics and medical genetics. Our investigation demonstrated the subtle changes of bio-factor entities' representations in the GP-GPT, which suggested the opportunities for the application of LLMs to advancing gene-phenotype research",arXiv
Emden: A novel method integrating graph and transformer representations for predicting the effect of mutations on clinical drug response,"Precision medicine based on personalized genomics provides promising strategies to enhance the efficacy of molecular-targeted therapies. However, the clinical effectiveness of drugs has been severely limited due to genetic variations that lead to drug resistance. Predicting the impact of missense mutations on clinical drug response is an essential way to reduce the cost of clinical trials and understand genetic diseases. Here, we present Emden, a novel method integrating graph and transformer representations that predicts the effect of missense mutations on drug response through binary classification with interpretability. Emden utilized protein sequences-based features and drug structures as inputs for rapid prediction, employing competitive representation learning and demonstrating strong generalization capabilities and robustness. Our study showed promising potential for clinical drug guidance and deep insight into computer-assisted precision medicine. Emden is freely available as a web server at https://www.psymukb.net/Emden",PubMed
Deep representation learning for clustering longitudinal survival data from electronic health records,"Precision medicine can be defined as providing the right treatment to the right patient at the right time, and it requires the ability to identify clinically relevant patient subgroups with high accuracy. The increasing availability of large-scale electronic health records (EHR) datasets has provided major opportunities for artificial intelligence and machine learning in mining such complex datasets for identifying novel disease subtypes. However, disease subtypes often exist in the context of certain disease-relevant risk events, and current efforts have been limited by analyzing clustering and event risk independently, resulting in subgroups that still display great heterogeneity in event risk and/or underlying molecular mechanisms.  To address this problem, we developed TransVarSur (Transformer Variational Survival modeling). TransVarSur integrates a Transformer-based Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder with time-to-event modeling to capture complex relationships between cluster-specific EHR trajectories and survival times. We validated TransVarSur by showing superior performance relative to baseline methods, on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets with known ground-truth clustering. We then applied TransVarSur to 1908 Crohns disease patients from the UK Biobank and successfully identified four clusters displaying both divergent EHR trajectories and divergent progression towards the risk event intestinal obstruction. A further analysis of the clusters revealed known clinical and genetic factors relevant in Crohns disease and progression to intestinal obstruction.  In conclusion, we demonstrated TransVarSurs ability to accurately stratify a patient population into clinically and genetically relevant, risk-associated subgroups. Hence, it can be a powerful tool in the development of precision medicine approaches",medrxiv
Comparative Analysis of Generative Pre-Trained Transformer Models in Oncogene-Driven Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Introducing the Generative Artificial Intelligence Performance Score,"Precision oncology in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) relies on biomarker testing for clinical decision making. Despite its importance, challenges like the lack of genomic oncology training, nonstandardized biomarker reporting, and a rapidly evolving treatment landscape hinder its practice. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, offers promise for enhancing clinical decision support. Effective performance metrics are crucial to evaluate these models' accuracy and their propensity for producing incorrect or hallucinated information. We assessed various ChatGPT versions' ability to generate accurate next-generation sequencing reports and treatment recommendations for NSCLC, using a novel Generative AI Performance Score (G-PS), which considers accuracy, relevancy, and hallucinations. We queried ChatGPT versions for first-line NSCLC treatment recommendations with an Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted therapy, using a zero-shot prompt approach for eight oncogenes. Responses were assessed against National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for accuracy, relevance, and hallucinations, with G-PS calculating scores from -1 (all hallucinations) to 1 (fully NCCN-compliant recommendations). G-PS was designed as a composite measure with a base score for correct recommendations (weighted for preferred treatments) and a penalty for hallucinations. Analyzing 160 responses, generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)-4 outperformed GPT-3.5, showing higher base score (90% v 60%; P < .01) and fewer hallucinations (34% v 53%; P < .01). GPT-4's overall G-PS was significantly higher (0.34 v -0.15; P < .01), indicating superior performance. This study highlights the rapid improvement of generative AI in matching treatment recommendations with biomarkers in precision oncology. Although the rate of hallucinations improved in the GPT-4 model, future generative AI use in clinical care requires high levels of accuracy with minimal to no room for hallucinations. The GP-S represents a novel metric quantifying generative AI utility in health care compared with national guidelines, with potential adaptation beyond precision oncology",PubMed
Predicting Genetic Mutation from Whole Slide Images via Biomedical-Linguistic Knowledge Enhanced Multi-label Classification,"Predicting genetic mutations from whole slide images is indispensable for cancer diagnosis. However, existing work training multiple binary classification models faces two challenges: (a) Training multiple binary classifiers is inefficient and would inevitably lead to a class imbalance problem. (b) The biological relationships among genes are overlooked, which limits the prediction performance. To tackle these challenges, we innovatively design a Biological-knowledge enhanced PathGenomic multi-label Transformer to improve genetic mutation prediction performances. BPGT first establishes a novel gene encoder that constructs gene priors by two carefully designed modules: (a) A gene graph whose node features are the genes' linguistic descriptions and the cancer phenotype, with edges modeled by genes' pathway associations and mutation consistencies. (b) A knowledge association module that fuses linguistic and biomedical knowledge into gene priors by transformer-based graph representation learning, capturing the intrinsic relationships between different genes' mutations. BPGT then designs a label decoder that finally performs genetic mutation prediction by two tailored modules: (a) A modality fusion module that firstly fuses the gene priors with critical regions in WSIs and obtains gene-wise mutation logits. (b) A comparative multi-label loss that emphasizes the inherent comparisons among mutation status to enhance the discrimination capabilities. Sufficient experiments on The Cancer Genome Atlas benchmark demonstrate that BPGT outperforms the state-of-the-art",arXiv
Knowledge-Driven Feature Selection and Engineering for Genotype Data with Large Language Models,"Predicting phenotypes with complex genetic bases based on a small, interpretable set of variant features remains a challenging task. Conventionally, data-driven approaches are utilized for this task, yet the high dimensional nature of genotype data makes the analysis and prediction difficult. Motivated by the extensive knowledge encoded in pre-trained LLMs and their success in processing complex biomedical concepts, we set to examine the ability of LLMs in feature selection and engineering for tabular genotype data, with a novel knowledge-driven framework. We develop FREEFORM, Free-flow Reasoning and Ensembling for Enhanced Feature Output and Robust Modeling, designed with chain-of-thought and ensembling principles, to select and engineer features with the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs. Evaluated on two distinct genotype-phenotype datasets, genetic ancestry and hereditary hearing loss, we find this framework outperforms several data-driven methods, particularly on low-shot regimes. FREEFORM is available as open-source framework at GitHub: https://github.com/PennShenLab/FREEFORM",arXiv
CroMAM: A Cross-Magnification Attention Feature Fusion Model for Predicting Genetic Status and Survival of Gliomas using Histological Images,"Predicting the gene mutation status in whole slide images (WSI) is crucial for the clinical treatment, cancer management, and research of gliomas. With advancements in CNN and Transformer algorithms, several promising models have been proposed. However, existing studies have paid little attention on fusing multi-magnification information, and the model requires processing all patches from a whole slide image. In this paper, we propose a cross-magnification attention model called CroMAM for predicting the genetic status and survival of gliomas. The CroMAM first utilizes a systematic patch extraction module to sample a subset of representative patches for downstream analysis. Next, the CroMAM applies Swin Transformer to extract local and global features from patches at different magnifications, followed by acquiring high-level features and dependencies among single-magnification patches through the application of a Vision Transformer. Subsequently, the CroMAM exchanges the integrated feature representations of different magnifications and encourage the integrated feature representations to learn the discriminative information from other magnification. Additionally, we design a cross-magnification attention analysis method to examine the effect of cross-magnification attention quantitatively and qualitatively which increases the model's explainability. To validate the performance of the model, we compare the proposed model with other multi-magnification feature fusion models on three tasks in two datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting the genetic status and survival of gliomas. The implementation of the CroMAM will be publicly available upon the acceptance of this manuscript at https://github.com/GuoJisen/CroMAM",PubMed
Prompting Whole Slide Image Based Genetic Biomarker Prediction,"Prediction of genetic biomarkers, e.g., microsatellite instability and BRAF in colorectal cancer is crucial for clinical decision making. In this paper, we propose a whole slide image (WSI) based genetic biomarker prediction method via prompting techniques. Our work aims at addressing the following challenges: (1) extracting foreground instances related to genetic biomarkers from gigapixel WSIs, and (2) the interaction among the fine-grained pathological components in WSIs.Specifically, we leverage large language models to generate medical prompts that serve as prior knowledge in extracting instances associated with genetic biomarkers. We adopt a coarse-to-fine approach to mine biomarker information within the tumor microenvironment. This involves extracting instances related to genetic biomarkers using coarse medical prior knowledge, grouping pathology instances into fine-grained pathological components and mining their interactions. Experimental results on two colorectal cancer datasets show the superiority of our method, achieving 91.49% in AUC for MSI classification. The analysis further shows the clinical interpretability of our method. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/PromptBio",arXiv
"Intrauterine Growth-Restricted Pregnant Rats, from Hypertensive Placental Ischemic Dams Display Preeclamptic-like Symptoms: A New Rodent Model of Preeclampsia","Preeclampsia (PE) is characterized by de novo hypertension (HTN) and is one of the primary causes of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). PE is associated with placental ischemia, decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, oxidative stress (OS), and organ damage in the kidneys and brain. This study aims to characterize a new model of PE using IUGR rats from hypertensive placental ischemic dams. It is hypothesized that pregnant IUGR rats from hypertensive placental ischemic dams will have elevated blood pressure (BP), OS, and organ damage.  MethodsPregnant Sprague Dawley rats are divided into 2 groups: normal pregnant (NP) and reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) hypertensive placental ischemic dams. Offspring from NP and RUPP dams were mated at 10 weeks of age to generate pregnant IUGR (IUGR Preg; n=3-8) and pregnant CON (CON Preg; n=3-6) rats. BP and other markers of PE were evaluated during late gestation.  ResultsPregnant IUGR rats had elevated BP and systemic OS, as demonstrated by higher trending 8-isoprostanes and lower circulating antioxidant capacity. Maternal body weight of pregnant IUGR rats and their pups weights were decreased, while the brains were enlarged. Brain OS was elevated, with a rise in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and heat shock protein 1 (HSP- 1), along with lower Manganese Superoxide Dismutase (MnSOD) and antioxidant capacity.  ConclusionPregnant IUGR rats, born from hypertensive placental ischemic dams, have HTN and increased systemic and brain OS, with larger brain sizes and smaller pups. Pregnant IUGR rats exhibit an preeclamptic-like phenotype, which suggests a new epigenetic model of PE",biorxiv
The causal role of male pubertal timing for the development of externalizing and internalizing traits: results from Mendelian randomization studies,"Preexisting epidemiological studies suggest that early pubertal development in males is associated with externalizing (e.g., conduct problems, risky behavior, and aggression) and internalizing (e.g., depression and anxiety) traits and disorders. However, due to problems inherent to observational studies, especially of reverse causation and residual confounding, it remains unclear whether these associations are causal. Mendelian randomization (MR) studies take advantage of the random allocation of genes at conception and can establish causal relationships. In the current study, N=76 independent genetic variants for male puberty timing (MPT) were derived from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 205,354 participants and used as an instrumental variable in MR studies on 17 externalizing and internalizing traits and psychopathologies utilizing outcome GWAS with 16,400 to 1,045,957 participants. In these MR studies, earlier MPT was significantly associated with higher scores for the overarching phenotype of  Externalizing Traits (beta=-0.03, 95%-CI [-0.06, -0.01]). However, this effect was likely driven by an earlier age at first sex (beta=-0.17, 95%-CI [-0.21, - 0.13]), without evidence for an effect on further externalizing phenotypes. Regarding internalizing phenotypes, earlier MPT was associated with higher levels of the  Depressed Affect subdomain of neuroticism (beta=-0.04, 95%-CI [-0.07, -0.01]). Late MPT was related to higher scores of internalizing traits in early life (beta=0.04, 95%-CI [0.01, 0.08]). In conclusion, this MR study supports a causal effect of MPT on specific traits and behaviors. However, no evidence for an effect of MPT on long-term clinical outcomes (depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol dependency, cannabis abuse) was found",medrxiv
Functional immunophenotyping of blood neutrophils identifies novel endotypes of viral response in preschool children with recurrent wheezing,"Preschool children with recurrent wheezing are heterogeneous, with differing responses to respiratory viral infections. Although neutrophils are crucial for host defense, their function has not been studied in this population. We performed functional immunophenotyping on isolated blood neutrophils from 52 preschool children with recurrent wheezing (aeroallergen sensitization, n = 16; no sensitization, n = 36). Blood neutrophils were purified and cultured overnight with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] as a viral analog stimulus. Neutrophils underwent next-generation sequencing with Reactome pathway analysis and were analyzed for cytokine secretion, apoptosis, myeloperoxidase, and extracellular DNA release. CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes were also exposed to neutrophil culture supernatant and analyzed for markers of M1 and M2 activation. A total of 495 genes, related largely to the innate immune system and neutrophil degranulation, were differently expressed in children with versus without aeroallergen sensitization. Functional experiments identified more neutrophil degranulation and extracellular trap formation (ie, more myeloperoxidase and extracellular DNA) and less neutrophil proinflammatory cytokine secretion in children with aeroallergen sensitization. Neutrophils also shifted CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes to a more anti-inflammatory (ie, M2) phenotype in sensitized children and a more proinflammatory (ie, M1) phenotype in nonsensitized children. Although both groups experienced viral exacerbations, annualized exacerbation rates prompting unscheduled health care were also higher in children without aeroallergen sensitization after enrollment. Systemic neutrophil responses to viral infection differ by allergic phenotype and may be less effective in preschool children without allergic inflammation. Further studies of neutrophil function are needed in this population, which often has less favorable therapeutic responses to inhaled corticosteroids and other therapies directed at type 2-high inflammation",PubMed
"JM-20 administration to animals with lesion of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway induced by 6-hydroxydopamine, partially reverses motor damage and oxidative stress","Previous studies have shown that JM-20, a new chemical hybrid molecule, protects against rotenone and 6-hydroxydopamine neurotoxicity. Also, we demonstrated that JM-20 blocks the formation of toxic alpha-synuclein aggregated species and aminochrome cytotoxicity. The present study sought to determine the neuroprotective property of JM-20 in animals with a partial lesion of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). For in vivo studies, adult male Wistar rats were lesioned in the right substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) with 6-OHDA administration. Fifteen days after surgery, the animals asymmetry levels were assessed. Those with asymmetry values higher than 50% were divided into two groups: animals that did not receive any treatment and those that were administered with JM-20 (40 mg/kg, intragastric via gavage) for 27 days. Every seven days, the asymmetry values of the animals were analyzed until day 42 after the surgery. At the end of the experiment, the animals were euthanized and the SNpc and striatum were taken out for the analysis of oxidative stress. Our results reveal a behavioral function progressively recovered in the JM-20-treated animals, diminishing the percentage of motor asymmetry. Also, it improves some oxidative stress markers in the SNpc and the striatum of these animals. Our study provides the preclinical evidence to support the long-term neuroprotective potential of JM-20 in 6-OHDA hemiparkinson rat model, pointing out to its possible use as a disease-modifying agent in PD",biorxiv
Primary Hyperparathyroidism and Cardiovascular Disease: An Association Study Using Clinical Natural Language Processing Systems and Big Data Analytics,"Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) seems to be associated with different cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). We evaluated the association of PHPT with major CV risk factors (CVRFs) and CVDs by using artificial intelligence (AI) tools. An observational and retrospective study was conducted using data from the electronic health records (EHRs) of the Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda (Spain). Of a total of 699,157 patients over 18 years of age studied (54.7% females), 6515 patients (0.9%; 65.4% women; mean age 67.6 ± 15.9 years) had a diagnosis of PHPT. The overall frequencies of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking habit in the cohort of patients with PTHP were all significantly (p < 0.001) higher than those found in patients without a diagnosis of PTHP. The total frequency of stroke, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism in the cohort of PHPT patients were significantly (p < 0.001) higher than that found in patients without the diagnosis of PHPT. A multivariate regression analysis showed that PHPT was significantly (p < 0.001) and independently associated with all the CVDs evaluated. Our data show that there is a significant association between the diagnosis of PHPT and the main CVRFs and CVDs in our hospital population",PubMed
Genetic and phenotype analyses of primary lateral sclerosis datasets from international cohorts,"Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is the rarest form of motor neurone disease (MND). It is characterized by upper motor neuron degeneration, leading to progressive weakness, spasticity and functional disability. Although PLS does not typically shorten life substantially, it gradually impacts quality of life as the diseases progresses. There is no established genetic cause of PLS. One of the biggest challenges faced by people with PLS is delayed diagnosis and misdiagnosis, since the initial symptoms can be similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common form of MND. In the absence of a concrete genetic test that differentiates PLS from other MNDs, this delay in diagnosis is inevitable. Understanding the genetic basis of PLS might help in reducing the time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis, and it will improve our understanding of the disease biology favouring the development of a treatment.  The aim of our study is to collect a large international PLS genetic and clinical dataset to investigate its genetic and phenotypic landscapes as well as to evaluate whether genetic testing should be advised in PLS. Through Project MinE and AnswerALS, we accessed whole-genome sequencing data of 120 PLS, 7405 ALS and 2444 controls. We identified variants in several MND genes such as FIG4, FUS, SPG7, SPG11 and SQSTM1 genes among others and repeat expansions in the ATXN1 (12.2%) and NIPA1 (7.3%) genes, but none in the C9orf72 and ATXN2 genes. Overall PLS patients harboured fewer clinically actionable MND-associated variants than ALS patients (p = 0.0001), however, depending on the panel, up to 11% of people with PLS might benefit from genetic testing. By looking at the clinical characteristics of these cohorts, the age of symptom onset was not younger for people with PLS than for those with ALS in both Project MinE and AnswerALS. On such bases, we advise that the current diagnostic criteria that discourage the use of genetic testing and rely on age of onset should be reconsidered",medrxiv

Relating to the Body Under Chronic Cancer Threat: Implications for Psychosocial Health Among Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer Predisposition Syndromes,"Purpose: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer predisposition syndromes often experience significant physical and psychosocial burdens. These burdens include cancer worry and potentially distressing bodily changes due to risk-reducing procedures (e.g., mastectomy) or cancer treatments. This qualitative-descriptive study explored how AYAs with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) relate and adjust to their bodies under the chronic threat of cancer. Methods: Participants were enrolled in the National Cancer Institute's LFS study. This analysis included 42 AYAs with LFS aged 15-39 years at enrollment who completed one or two telephone interviews that explored LFS-related bodily experiences and challenges. Transcripts were thematically analyzed. Results: The majority of participants (n = 26/42, 62%) had ≥1 primary cancer. The mean age at first cancer diagnosis was 21 years (range = 0.5-35 years). Participants described challenges relating to the body due to frequent self-monitoring, whole-body magnetic resonance imaging scans, risk-reducing surgeries, and/or cancer treatments. Heightened body awareness and vigilance not only prompted self-protective behaviors but also triggered worry and distress. AYAs coped with bodily changes and concerns by seeking doctors' reassurance, engaging in health-protective behaviors, and reframing perceptions of their altered bodies. Conclusion: Findings suggest AYAs with cancer predisposition syndromes such as LFS experience difficulties relating and adjusting to the body that may compromise psychosocial health. Our results demonstrate that these difficulties may arise across the time course of genetic disease, including before a cancer diagnosis. Clinicians might support AYAs by conducting routine psychosocial risk assessments, providing anticipatory guidance regarding body-related challenges, sharing peer support resources, and referring to mental health providers, as needed",PubMed
Advancing Understanding of Inequities in Rare Disease Genomics,"PurposeAdvances in genomic research have led to the diagnosis of rare, early-onset diseases for thousands of individuals. Unfortunately, the benefits of advanced genetic diagnostic technology are not distributed equitably among the population, as has been seen in many other healthcare contexts. Even quantifying and describing inequities in genetic diagnostic yield is challenging due to variation in referrals to clinical genetics practices and other barriers to clinical genetic testing.  MethodsThe Rare Genomes Project (RGP) at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard offers research genome sequencing to individuals with rare disease who remain genetically undiagnosed through direct interaction with the individual or family. This presents an opportunity for diagnosis beyond the clinical context, thus eliminating many barriers to access.  FindingsAn initial goal of RGP was to equalize access to genomic sequencing by decoupling testing access from proximity to a major medical center and physician referral. However, our study participants are overwhelmingly non-disadvantaged, as evidenced by their access to specialist care and genetic testing prior to RGP enrollment, and are also predominantly white.  ImplicationsWe therefore describe our novel initiative to diversify RGP enrollment in order to advance equity in rare disease genetic diagnosis and research. In addition to the moral imperative of medical equity, this is also critical in order to fully understand the genomic underpinnings of rare disease. We utilize a mixed methods approach to understand the priorities and values of underrepresented communities, existing disparities, and the obstacles to addressing them: all of which is necessary to promote equity in future genomic medicine initiatives",medrxiv
Diverse Participant Recruitment for Infant Sequencing in the BabySeq Project,"PurposeIt is essential that studies of genomic sequencing (GS) in newborns and children include individuals from under-represented racial and ethnic groups (URG) to ensure future applications are equitably implemented. We conducted interviews with parents from URG to better understand their perspectives on GS research, develop strategies to reduce barriers to enrollment, and facilitate research participation.  MethodsSemi-structured interviews with 50 parents from URG.  ResultsNearly all parents (44) said they would be interested in participating in an infant GS study. Parents were interested in participating in GS research for reasons including clinical utility, personal utility, and/or family health benefits. Deterrents to enrollment cited by parents were discomfort with enrollment procedures (e.g., not wanting a heel stick), limited emotional bandwidth, unfavorable perceptions of the study, and concerns about potential results. Most parents (35 of 40) said they would want to receive all types of genetic results, including actionable and non-actionable, as well as childhood- and adult-onset.  ConclusionOur findings demonstrate that parents from URG are interested in participating in GS research. Based upon these findings, we provide recommendations for designing GS studies that are responsive to their concerns",medrxiv
AutoPM3: Enhancing Variant Interpretation via LLM-driven PM3 Evidence Extraction from Scientific Literature,"Rare diseases, affecting 300 million people globally, often result from genetic variants. Wholegenome sequencing has made variant detection more cost-effective, but interpreting these variants remains challenging. Current clinical practice combines quantitative evidence and literature, which is complex and time-consuming. We introduce AutoPM3, a method for automating the extraction of ACMG/AMP PM3 evidence from scientific literature using open-source LLMs. It combines an optimized RAG system for text comprehension and a TableLLM equipped with Text2SQL for data extraction. We evaluated AutoPM3 using our collected PM3-Bench, a dataset from ClinGen with 1,027 variant-publication pairs. AutoPM3 significantly outperformed other methods in variant hit and in trans variant identification, thanks to the four key modules. Additionally, we wrapped AutoPM3 with a user-friendly interface to enhance its accessibility. This study presents a powerful tool to improve rare disease diagnosis workflows by facilitating PM3-relevant evidence extraction from scientific literature",biorxiv
Estimating prevalence of rare genetic disease diagnoses using electronic health records in a children's hospital,"Rare genetic diseases (RGDs) affect a significant number of individuals, particularly in pediatric populations. This study investigates the efficacy of identifying RGD diagnoses through electronic health records (EHRs) and natural language processing (NLP) tools, and analyzes the prevalence of identified RGDs for potential underdiagnosis at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). EHR data from 659,139 pediatric patients at CCHMC were utilized. Diagnoses corresponding to RGDs in Orphanet were identified using rule-based and machine learning-based NLP methods. Manual evaluation assessed the precision of the NLP strategies, with 100 diagnosis descriptions reviewed for each method. The rule-based method achieved a precision of 97.5% (95% CI: 91.5%, 99.4%), while the machine-learning-based method had a precision of 73.5% (95% CI: 63.6%, 81.6%). A manual chart review of 70 randomly selected patients with RGD diagnoses confirmed the diagnoses in 90.3% (95% CI: 82.0%, 95.2%) of cases. A total of 37,326 pediatric patients were identified with 977 RGD diagnoses based on the rule-based method, resulting in a prevalence of 5.66% in this population. While a majority of the disorders showed a higher prevalence at CCHMC compared with Orphanet, some diseases, such as 1p36 deletion syndrome, indicated potential underdiagnosis. Analyses further uncovered disparities in RGD prevalence and age of diagnosis across gender and racial groups. This study demonstrates the utility of employing EHR data with NLP tools to systematically investigate RGD diagnoses in large cohorts. The identified disparities underscore the need for enhanced approaches to guarantee timely and accurate diagnosis and management of pediatric RGDs",PubMed
Leveraging Large Language Models in Gynecologic Oncology: A Systematic Review of Current Applications and Challenges,"Rationale and ObjectivesOver the past year, studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, in the fields of gynecologic oncology. This review aims to analyze the applications and risks associated with using LLMs in this specialized field.  Materials and MethodsThis systematic review was performed in adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, incorporating elements from the diagnostic test accuracy extension and the CHARMS checklist for reviews of prediction models. A systematic literature search was executed on July 17, 2024, across PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. We focused on identifying original research that integrates LLMs with gynecologic oncology. We assessed the risk of bias using the adapted QUADAS-2 criteria.  ResultsOur search identified eight studies that met our criteria, focusing on healthcare education, clinical practice, and medical code generation. These studies revealed variability in ChatGPTs performance across different applications. It excelled in genetic testing and counseling, achieving 97% accuracy rate. However, its performance in cervical cancer prevention was less robust, with an accuracy of 83%. While one study demonstrated ChatGPTs high adherence to quality guidelines, another noted that established guidelines significantly outperformed ChatGPTs outputs. Additionally, code generation using tools like Google Bard and RoBERTa have shown potential to improve accuracy in clinical predictions and quality assurance. For example, Natural Language Processing (NLP) assisted by RoBERTa (based on Googles BERT model) has improved the prediction of residual disease in women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer following cytoreductive surgery. Despite these advancements, challenges related to consistency, specificity, and personalization persist, underscoring the necessity for continuous enhancement of these technologies.  ConclusionLLMs demonstrate inconsistent performance in gynecologic oncology. These findings emphasize the need for continuous evaluation of these models before they are implemented clinically",medrxiv
Incomplete Multimodal Learning for Complex Brain Disorders Prediction,"Recent advancements in the acquisition of various brain data sources have created new opportunities for integrating multimodal brain data to assist in early detection of complex brain disorders. However, current data integration approaches typically need a complete set of biomedical data modalities, which may not always be feasible, as some modalities are only available in large-scale research cohorts and are prohibitive to collect in routine clinical practice. Especially in studies of brain diseases, research cohorts may include both neuroimaging data and genetic data, but for practical clinical diagnosis, we often need to make disease predictions only based on neuroimages. As a result, it is desired to design machine learning models which can use all available data (different data could provide complementary information) during training but conduct inference using only the most common data modality. We propose a new incomplete multimodal data integration approach that employs transformers and generative adversarial networks to effectively exploit auxiliary modalities available during training in order to improve the performance of a unimodal model at inference. We apply our new method to predict cognitive degeneration and disease outcomes using the multimodal imaging genetic data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the related machine learning and deep learning methods by a significant margin",arXiv
Pollen foraging mediates exposure to dichotomous stressor syndromes in honey bees,"Recent declines in the health of honey bee colonies used for crop pollination pose a considerable threat to global food security. Foraging by honey bee workers represents the primary route of exposure to a plethora of toxins and pathogens known to affect bee health, but it remains unclear how foraging preferences impact colony-level patterns of stressor exposure. Resolving this knowledge gap is crucial for enhancing the health of honey bees and the agricultural systems that rely on them for pollination. To address this, we carried out a national-scale experiment encompassing 456 Canadian honey bee colonies to first characterize pollen foraging preferences in relation to major crops, then explore how foraging behaviour influences patterns of stressor exposure. We used a metagenetic approach to quantify honey bee dietary breadth and found that bees display distinct foraging preferences that vary substantially relative to crop type and proximity, and the breadth of foraging interactions can be used to predict the abundance and diversity of stressors a colony is exposed to. Foraging on diverse plant communities was associated with increased exposure to pathogens, while the opposite was associated with increased exposure to xenobiotics. Our work provides the first large-scale empirical evidence that pollen foraging behaviour plays an influential role in determining exposure to dichotomous stressor syndromes in honey bees.  Significance StatementInsect-mediated pollination is an important ecological process that is crucial for food production. Managed honey bee colonies are one of the most important insect pollinators, but their health has been under threat from a variety of stressors. Bee workers are primarily exposed to stressors while foraging and understanding how bee foraging preferences are related to exposure risk could provide pivotal information to improve management efforts. Here, we studied honey bee foraging preferences in relation to prominent Canadian crops and across a gradient of modified environments. We found that honey bees show distinct, measurable foraging preferences and that dietary diversity is a strong predictor of the stressors that colonies are exposed to",biorxiv
ProtGO: A Transformer based Fusion Model for accurately predicting Gene Ontology (GO) Terms from full scale Protein Sequences,"Recent developments in next generation sequencing technology have led to the creation of extensive, open-source protein databases consisting of hundreds of millions of sequences. To render these sequences applicable in biomedical applications, they must be meticulously annotated by wet lab testing or extracting them from existing literature. Over the last few years, researchers have developed numerous automatic annotation systems, particularly deep learning models based on machine learning and artificial intelligence, to address this issue. In this work, we propose a transformer-based fusion model capable of predicting Gene Ontology (GO) terms from full-scale protein sequences, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other contemporary machine learning annotation systems. The approach performs particularly well on clustered split datasets, which comprise training and testing samples originating from distinct distributions that are structurally diverse. This demonstrates that the model is able to understand both short and long term dependencies within the enzyme's structure and can precisely identify the motifs associated with the various GO terms. Furthermore, the technique is lightweight and less computationally expensive compared to the benchmark methods, while at the same time not unaffected by sequence length, rendering it appropriate for diverse applications with varying sequence lengths",arXiv
A Deep Attention-Based Encoder for the Prediction of Type 2 Diabetes Longitudinal Outcomes from Routinely Collected Health Care Data,"Recent evidence indicates that Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease involving various pathophysiological and genetic pathways, which presents clinicians with challenges in disease management. While deep learning models have made significant progress in helping practitioners manage T2DM treatments, several important limitations persist. In this paper we propose DARE, a model based on the transformer encoder, designed for analyzing longitudinal heterogeneous diabetes data. The model can be easily fine-tuned for various clinical prediction tasks, enabling a computational approach to assist clinicians in the management of the disease. We trained DARE using data from over 200,000 diabetic subjects from the primary healthcare SIDIAP database, which includes diagnosis and drug codes, along with various clinical and analytical measurements. After an unsupervised pre-training phase, we fine-tuned the model for predicting three specific clinical outcomes: i) occurrence of comorbidity, ii) achievement of target glycaemic control (defined as glycated hemoglobin < 7%) and iii) changes in glucose-lowering treatment. In cross-validation, the embedding vectors generated by DARE outperformed those from baseline models (comorbidities prediction task AUC = 0.88, treatment prediction task AUC = 0.91, HbA1c target prediction task AUC = 0.82). Our findings suggest that attention-based encoders improve results with respect to different deep learning and classical baseline models when used to predict different clinical relevant outcomes from T2DM longitudinal data",medrxiv
MCNMF-Unet: a mixture Conv-MLP network with multi-scale features fusion Unet for medical image segmentation,"Recently, the medical image segmentation scheme combining Vision Transformer (ViT) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) has been widely used. However, one of its disadvantages is that the feature fusion ability of different levels is weak and lacks flexible localization information. To reduce the semantic gap between the encoding and decoding stages, we propose a mixture conv-MLP network with multi-scale features fusion Unet (MCNMF-Unet) for medical image segmentation. MCNMF-Unet is a U-shaped network based on convolution and MLP, which not only inherits the advantages of convolutional in extracting underlying features and visual structures, but also utilizes MLP to fuse local and global information of each layer of the network. MCNMF-Unet performs multi-layer fusion and multi-scale feature map skip connections in each network stage so that all the feature information can be fully utilized and the gradient disappearance problem can be alleviated. Additionally, MCNMF-Unet incorporates a multi-axis and multi-windows MLP module. This module is fully end-to-end and eliminates the need to consider the negative impact of image cropping. It not only fuses information from multiple dimensions and receptive fields but also reduces the number of parameters and computational complexity. We evaluated the proposed model on BUSI, ISIC2018 and CVC-ClinicDB datasets. The experimental results show that the performance of our proposed model is superior to most existing networks, with an IoU of 84.04% and a F1-score of 91.18%",PubMed
Heterogeneity in RAG1 and RAG2 deficiency: 35 cases from a single-centre,"Recombination activating genes (RAG)1 and RAG2 deficiency leads to combined T/B-cell deficiency with varying clinical presentations. This study aimed to define the clinical/laboratory spectrum of RAG1 and RAG2 deficiency. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical/laboratory data of 35 patients, grouped them as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), Omenn syndrome (OS), and delayed-onset combined immunodeficiency (CID) and reported nine novel mutations. The male/female ratio was 23/12. Median age of clinical manifestations was 1 months (mo) (0.5-2), 2 mo (1.25-5), and 14 mo (3.63-27), age at diagnosis was 4 mo (3-6), 4.5 mo (2.5-9.75), and 27 mo (14.5-70) in SCID (n = 25; 71.4%), OS (n = 5; 14.3%), and CID (n = 5; 14.3%) patients, respectively. Common clinical manifestations were recurrent sinopulmonary infections 82.9%, oral moniliasis 62.9%, diarrhea 51.4%, and eczema/dermatitis 42.9%. Autoimmune features were present in 31.4% of the patients; 80% were in CID patients. Lymphopenia was present in 92% of SCID, 80% of OS, and 80% of CID patients. All SCID and CID patients had low T (CD3, CD4, and CD8), low B, and increased NK cell numbers. Twenty-eight patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), whereas seven patients died before HSCT. Median age at HSCT was 7 mo (4-13.5). Survival differed in groups; maximum in SCID patients who had an HLA-matched family donor, minimum in OS. Totally 19 (54.3%) patients survived. Early molecular genetic studies will give both individualized therapy options, and a survival advantage because of timely diagnosis and treatment. Further improvement in therapeutic outcomes will be possible if clinicians gain time for HSCT",PubMed
Genetically corrected RAG2-SCID human hematopoietic stem cells restore V(D)J-recombinase and rescue lymphoid deficiency,"Recombination-activating genes (RAG1 and RAG2) are critical for lymphoid cell development and function by initiating the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) (V(D)J)-recombination process to generate polyclonal lymphocytes with broad antigen specificity. The clinical manifestations of defective RAG1/2 genes range from immune dysregulation to severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCIDs), causing life-threatening infections and death early in life without hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Despite improvements, haploidentical HCT without myeloablative conditioning carries a high risk of graft failure and incomplete immune reconstitution. The RAG complex is only expressed during the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle in the early stages of T- and B-cell development, underscoring that a direct gene correction might capture the precise temporal expression of the endogenous gene. Here, we report a feasibility study using the CRISPR/Cas9-based ""universal gene-correction"" approach for the RAG2 locus in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from healthy donors and RAG2-SCID patient. V(D)J-recombinase activity was restored after gene correction of RAG2-SCID-derived HSPCs, resulting in the development of T-cell receptor (TCR) αβ and γδ CD3+ cells and single-positive CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. TCR repertoire analysis indicated a normal distribution of CDR3 length and preserved usage of the distal TRAV genes. We confirmed the in vivo rescue of B-cell development with normal immunoglobulin M surface expression and a significant decrease in CD56bright natural killer cells. Together, we provide specificity, toxicity, and efficacy data supporting the development of a gene-correction therapy to benefit RAG2-deficient patients",PubMed
Are COVID-19 Polymorphisms in ACE and ACE2 Prognosis Predictors?,"Regardless of the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it remains paramount to comprehensively understand its underlying mechanisms to mitigate potential future health and economic impacts, comparable to those experienced throughout the course of the pandemic. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) provides anchorage for SARS-CoV-2 binding, thus implicating that ACE and ACE2 might contribute to the variability in infection severity. This study aimed to elucidate predisposing factors influencing the disease course among people infected by SARS-CoV-2, focusing on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 polymorphisms. Notably, despite similar demographics and comorbidities, COVID-19 patients exhibit substantial differences in prognosis. Genetic polymorphisms in ACE and ACE2 have been implicated in disease progression, prompting our investigation into their role in COVID-19 evolution. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), we analyzed ACE and ACE2 genes in a sample group comprising six subjects infected by SARS-CoV-2. Our findings revealed a correlation between specific polymorphisms and COVID-19 outcomes. Specifically, ACE and ACE2 intronic deletions were observed in all deceased patients, suggesting a potential association with mortality. These results highlight the significance of genetic factors in shaping the clinical course of COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of further research into the impact of genetic variations on COVID-19 severity",PubMed

Comprehensive and accurate genome analysis at scale using DRAGEN accelerated algorithms,"Research and medical genomics require comprehensive and scalable solutions to drive the discovery of novel disease targets, evolutionary drivers, and genetic markers with clinical significance. This necessitates a framework to identify all types of variants independent of their size (e.g., SNV/SV) or location (e.g., repeats). Here we present DRAGEN that utilizes novel methods based on multigenomes, hardware acceleration, and machine learning based variant detection to provide novel insights into individual genomes with [~]30min computation time (from raw reads to variant detection). DRAGEN outperforms all other state-of-the-art methods in speed and accuracy across all variant types (SNV, indel, STR, SV, CNV) and further incorporates specialized methods to obtain key insights in medically relevant genes (e.g., HLA, SMN, GBA).

We tasked the GPT-4 Chatbot with generating 2 1,000-word reviews on the topics of hereditary angioedema and eosinophilic esophagitis. Authors critically appraised these articles using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tool for text and opinion and additionally evaluated domains of interest such as language, reference quality, and accuracy of the content. The language of the AI-generated minireviews was carefully articulated and logically focused on the topic of interest; however, reviewers of the AI-generated articles indicated that the AI-generated content lacked depth, did not appear to be the result of an analytical process, missed critical information, and contained inaccurate information. Despite being provided instruction to utilize scientific references, the AI chatbot relied mainly on freely available resources, and the AI chatbot fabricated references. The AI holds the potential to change the landscape of synthesizing medical literature; however, apparent inaccurate and fabricated information calls for rigorous evaluation and validation of AI tools in generating medical literature, especially on subjects associated with limited resources",PubMed
Robo1 loss has pleiotropic effects on postnatal development and survival,"Roundabout guidance receptor 1 (Robo1) is known to function during midbrain development in mice, but its postnatal role remains poorly defined in part due to the perinatal lethality of the mice lacking the gene. Here, we describe the postnatal phenotypes of Robo1-/- mice in the B6/129s genetic background. Robo1-/- mice had both a slower growth rate and shorter lifespan compared to Robo1+/+ littermates. Skin histological analysis revealed that Robo1-/- mice displayed increased wrinkles, enlarged sebaceous glands, and a reduced subcutaneous fat layer. Robo1-/- mice displayed accelerated hair graying in line with an observed overall decrease in melanin production. Although both growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth hormone 1 (IGF-1) were suppressed in Robo1-deficient mice at 3 weeks of age, they were expressed at similar levels to Robo1 intact mice at 7 weeks of age. These findings suggest that Robo1-mediated hormone regulation is required for normal growth during the early stages of puberty and may provide a crucial timepoint at which to examine the molecular mechanisms of pituitary disorders",biorxiv
A novel RYR1 variant in an infant with a unique fetal presentation of central core disease,"Ryanodine receptor type 1-related disorder (RYR1-RD) is the most common subgroup of congenital myopathies with a wide phenotypic spectrum ranging from mild hypotonia to lethal fetal akinesia. Genetic testing for myopathies is imperative as the diagnosis informs counseling regarding prognosis and recurrence risk, treatment options, monitoring, and clinical management. However, diagnostic challenges exist as current options are limited to clinical suspicion prompting testing including: single gene sequencing or familial variant testing, multi-gene panels, exome, genome sequencing, and invasive testing including muscle biopsy. The timing of diagnosis is of great importance due to the association of RYR1-RD with malignant hyperthermia (MH). MH is a hypermetabolic crisis that occurs secondary to excessive calcium release in muscles, leading to systemic effects that can progress to shock and death if unrecognized. Given the association of MH with pathogenic variants in RYR1, a diagnosis of RYR1-RD necessitates an awareness of medical team to avoid potentially triggering agents. We describe a case of a unique fetal presentation with bilateral diaphragmatic eventrations who had respiratory failure, dysmorphic facial features, and profound global hypotonia in the neonatal period. The diagnosis was made at several months of age, had direct implications on her clinical care related to anticipated need to long-term ventilator support, and ultimately death secondary an arrhythmia as a result of suspected MH. Our report reinforces the importance of having high suspicion for a genetic syndrome and pursuing early, rapid exome or genome sequencing as first line testing in critically ill neonatal intensive care unit patients and further evaluating the pathogenicity of a variant of uncertain significance in the setting of a myopathic phenotype",PubMed
Precision phenotyping for curating research cohorts of patients with unexplained post-acute sequelae of COVID-19,"Scalable identification of patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) is challenging due to a lack of reproducible precision phenotyping algorithms, which has led to suboptimal accuracy, demographic biases, and underestimation of the PASC. In a retrospective case-control study, we developed a precision phenotyping algorithm for identifying cohorts of patients with PASC. We used longitudinal electronic health records data from over 295,000 patients from 14 hospitals and 20 community health centers in Massachusetts. The algorithm employs an attention mechanism to simultaneously exclude sequelae that prior conditions can explain and include infection-associated chronic conditions. We performed independent chart reviews to tune and validate the algorithm. The PASC phenotyping algorithm improves precision and prevalence estimation and reduces bias in identifying PASC cohorts compared to the ICD-10-CM code U09.9. The algorithm identified a cohort of over 24,000 patients with 79.9% precision. Our estimated prevalence of PASC was 22.8%, which is close to the national estimates for the region. We also provide in-depth analyses, encompassing identified lingering effects by organ, comorbidity profiles, and temporal differences in the risk of PASC. PASC precision phenotyping boasts superior precision and prevalence estimation while exhibiting less bias in identifying patients with PASC. The cohort derived from this algorithm will serve as a springboard for delving into the genetic, metabolomic, and clinical intricacies of PASC, surmounting the constraints of prior PASC cohort studies. This research was funded by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)",PubMed
Precision Phenotyping for Curating Research Cohorts of Patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) as a Diagnosis of Exclusion,"Scalable identification of patients with the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) is challenging due to a lack of reproducible precision phenotyping algorithms and the suboptimal accuracy, demographic biases, and underestimation of the PASC diagnosis code (ICD-10 U09.9). In a retrospective case-control study, we developed a precision phenotyping algorithm for identifying research cohorts of PASC patients, defined as a diagnosis of exclusion.

The algorithm employs an attention mechanism to exclude sequelae that prior conditions can explain. We performed independent chart reviews to tune and validate our precision phenotyping algorithm. Our PASC phenotyping algorithm improves precision and prevalence estimation and reduces bias in identifying Long COVID patients compared to the U09.9 diagnosis code. Our algorithm identified a PASC research cohort of over 24 thousand patients (compared to about 6 thousand when using the U09.9 diagnosis code), with a 79.9 percent precision (compared to 77.8 percent from the U09.9 diagnosis code). Our estimated prevalence of PASC was 22.8 percent, which is close to the national estimates for the region. We also provide an in-depth analysis outlining the clinical attributes, encompassing identified lingering effects by organ, comorbidity profiles, and temporal differences in the risk of PASC. The PASC phenotyping method presented in this study boasts superior precision, accurately gauges the prevalence of PASC without underestimating it, and exhibits less bias in pinpointing Long COVID patients. The PASC cohort derived from our algorithm will serve as a springboard for delving into Long COVID's genetic, metabolomic, and clinical intricacies, surmounting the constraints of recent PASC cohort studies, which were hampered by their limited size and available outcome data

PIC recruitment by synthetic reader-actuators to polycomb-silenced genes blocks triple-negative breast cancer invasion,"Scientists have used small molecule inhibitors and genetic knockdown of gene-silencing polycomb repressive complexes (PRC1/2) to determine if restoring the expression of tumor suppressor genes can block proliferation and invasion of cancer cells. A major limitation of this approach is that inhibitors can not restore key transcriptional activators that are mutated in many cancers, such as p53 and members of the BRAF SWI/SNF complex. Furthermore, small molecule inhibitors can alter the activity of, rather than inhibit, the polycomb enzyme EZH2. While chromatin has been shown to play a major role in gene regulation in cancer, poor clinical results for polycomb chromatin-targeting therapies for diseases like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) could discourage further development of this emerging avenue for treatment. To overcome the limitations of inhibiting polycomb to study epigenetic regulation, we developed an engineered chromatin protein to manipulate transcription. The synthetic reader-actuator (SRA) is a fusion protein that directly binds a target chromatin modification and regulates gene expression. Here, we report the activity of an SRA built from polycomb chromodomain and VP64 modules that bind H3K27me3 and subunits of the Mediator complex, respectively. In SRA-expressing BT-549 cells, we identified 122 upregulated differentially expressed genes (UpDEGs, [&ge;] 2-fold activation, adjusted p < 0.05). On-target epigenetic regulation was determined by identifying UpDEGs at H3K27me3-enriched, closed chromatin. SRA activity induced activation of genes involved in cell death, cell cycle arrest, and the inhibition of migration and invasion. SRA-expressing BT-549 cells showed reduced spheroid size in Matrigel over time, loss of invasion, and activation of apoptosis. These results show that Mediator-recruiting regulators broadly targeted to silenced chromatin activate silenced tumor suppressor genes and stimulate anti-cancer phenotypes. Therefore further development of gene-activating epigenetic therapies might benefit TNBC patients",biorxiv
Identification of pancreatic cancer risk factors from clinical notes using natural language processing,"Screening for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is considered in high-risk individuals (HRIs) with established PDAC risk factors, such as family history and germline mutations in PDAC susceptibility genes. Accurate assessment of risk factor status is provider knowledge-dependent and requires extensive manual chart review by experts. Natural Language Processing (NLP) has shown promise in automated data extraction from the electronic health record (EHR). We aimed to use NLP for automated extraction of PDAC risk factors from unstructured clinical notes in the EHR. We first developed rule-based NLP algorithms to extract PDAC risk factors at the document-level, using an annotated corpus of 2091 clinical notes. Next, we further improved the NLP algorithms using a cohort of 1138 patients through patient-level training, validation, and testing, with comparison against a pre-specified reference standard. To minimize false-negative results we prioritized algorithm recall. In the test set (n = 807), the NLP algorithms achieved a recall of 0.933, precision of 0.790, and F<sub>1</sub>-score of 0.856 for family history of PDAC. For germline genetic mutations, the algorithm had a high recall of 0.851, while precision and F<sub>1</sub>-score were lower at 0.350 and 0.496 respectively. Most false positives for germline mutations resulted from erroneous recognition of tissue mutations. Rule-based NLP algorithms applied to unstructured clinical notes are highly sensitive for automated identification of PDAC risk factors. Further validation in a large primary-care patient population is warranted to assess real-world utility in identifying HRIs for pancreatic cancer screening",PubMed
A robust and lightweight deep attention multiple instance learning algorithm for predicting genetic alterations,"Self-attention mechanism-based algorithms are attractive in digital pathology due to their interpretability, but suffer from computation complexity. This paper presents a novel, lightweight Attention-based Multiple Instance Mutation Learning (AMIML) model to allow small-scale attention operations for predicting gene mutations. Compared to the standard self-attention model, AMIML reduces the number of model parameters by approximately 70%. Using data for 24 clinically relevant genes from four cancer cohorts in TCGA studies (UCEC, BRCA, GBM, and KIRC), we compare AMIML with a standard self-attention model, five other deep learning models, and four traditional machine learning models. The results show that AMIML has excellent robustness and outperforms all the baseline algorithms in the vast majority of the tested genes. Conversely, the performance of the reference deep learning and machine learning models vary across different genes, and produce suboptimal prediction for certain genes. Furthermore, with the flexible and interpretable attention-based pooling mechanism, AMIML can further zero in and detect predictive image patches",PubMed
Dissecting the contribution of vagal subcircuits in sepsis-induced brain dysfunctions,"Sepsis, a life-threatening syndrome caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, induces a range of acute effects on the brain, including sickness behaviour and sepsis-associated encephalopathy. In addition, sepsis can lead to durable changes in neuronal circuits, resulting in long-term impairments such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These brain dysfunctions are not directly caused by brain infection but result from peripheral inflammatory signals relayed to the brain via neural and humoral pathways. The vagal complex in the brainstem, composed of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and the area postrema, plays a crucial role in sensing and relaying these signals. Notably, the activation of the vagal complex triggers neurovegetative, neuroendocrine, and behavioural responses to infection. Chronic electrical vagus nerve stimulation has been used clinically to treat various brain disorders and is being investigated for its potential to alleviate inflammation and immune diseases through the anti-inflammatory reflex. However, a deeper understanding of the involvement of the vagus nerve and downstream brain circuits in sepsis-induced brain activation and dysfunction is needed to optimize therapeutic strategies.  To investigate the role of the vagal complex in sepsis-induced brain dysfunction, various techniques were employed to manipulate vagus nerve activity and downstream circuits in a rodent model of sepsis by caecal ligation and puncture. Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy and pharmacogenetic manipulation of NTS and nodose (i.e. vagus sensory neurons) were implemented, revealing that vagotomy effectively reduced acute brain activation, inflammatory responses, and sickness behaviour triggered by sepsis. Additionally, transient activation of NTS neurons had a significant impact on inflammatory responses, sickness behaviour, and long-term PTSD-like consequences. This study underscores the complex interplay among the vagus nerve, brain circuits, and systemic inflammation during sepsis, emphasizing the critical importance of understanding these interactions in the development of targeted therapeutic interventions",biorxiv
Interpretation knowledge extraction for genetic testing via question-answer model,"Sequencing-based genetic testing is widely used in biomedical research, including pathogenic microorganism detection with metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). The application of sequencing results to clinical diagnosis and treatment relies on various interpretation knowledge bases. Currently, the existing knowledge bases are primarily built through manual knowledge extraction. This method requires professionals to read extensive literature and extract relevant knowledge from it, which is time-consuming and costly. Furthermore, manual extraction unavoidably introduces subjective biases. In this study, we aimed to automatically extract knowledge for interpreting mNGS results. We propose a novel approach to automatically extract pathogenic microorganism knowledge based on the question-answer (QA) model. First, we construct a MicrobeDB dataset since there is no available pathogenic microorganism QA dataset for training the model. The created dataset contains 3,161 samples from 618 published papers covering 224 pathogenic microorganisms. Then, we fine-tune the selected baseline model based on MicrobeDB. Finally, we utilize ChatGPT to enhance the diversity of training data, and employ data expansion to increase training data volume. Our method achieves an Exact Match (EM) and F1 score of 88.39% and 93.18%, respectively, on the MicrobeDB test set. We also conduct ablation studies on the proposed data augmentation method. In addition, we perform comparative experiments with the ChatPDF tool based on the ChatGPT API to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our method is effective and valuable for extracting pathogenic microorganism knowledge",PubMed
Perinatal serotonin signalling dynamically influences the development of cortical GABAergic circuits with consequences for lifelong sensory encoding,"Serotonin plays a prominent role in neurodevelopment, regulating processes from cell division to synaptic connectivity1,2. Clinical studies suggest that alterations in serotonin signalling such as genetic polymorphisms3-5 or antidepressant exposure during pregnancy6,7 are risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders. However, an understanding of how dysfunctional neuromodulation alters systems level activity over neocortical development is lacking. Here, we use a longitudinal imaging approach to investigate how genetics, pharmacology, and aversive experience disrupt state-dependent serotonin signalling with pathological consequences for sensory processing. We find that all three factors lead to increased neocortical serotonin levels during the initial postnatal period. Genetic deletion of the serotonin transporter or antidepressant dosing results in a switch from hypo- to hyper-cortical activity that arises as a consequence of altered cortical GABAergic microcircuitry. However, the trajectories of these manipulations differ with postnatal exposure to antidepressants having effects on adult sensory encoding. The latter is not seen in the genetic model despite a similar early phenotype, and a distinct influence of maternal genotype on the development of supragranular layers. These results reveal the dynamics and critical nature of serotonin signalling during perinatal life; pharmacological targeting of which can have profound life-long consequences for cognitive development of the offspring",biorxiv
From variant of uncertain significance to likely pathogenic in two siblings with atypical RAG2 Deficiency: a case report and review of the literature,"Severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCIDs) are hereditary disorders characterized by impaired T and B cell function, resulting in significant immune system dysfunction. Recombination-activating gene (RAG) mutations account for a substantial proportion of SCID cases. Here, we present two sibling cases of SCID caused by a novel RAG2 gene mutation. The index case was an 8-year-old boy who had a history of recurring infections. After a comprehensive immunological workup, the initial diagnosis of agammaglobulinemia was revised to combined immunodeficiency (CID). The patient underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) but succumbed to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. His brother, a 4-month-old boy, presented with CMV chorioretinitis. Leaky SCID was diagnosed based on genetic tests and immunological findings. The patient received appropriate treatment and was considered for HSCT. Both siblings had a homozygous RAG2 gene variant, with the first case classified as a variant of uncertain significance (VUS). The presence of the same mutation in the second brother, and the clinical phenotype, supports considering the mutation as likely pathogenic. This case report highlights a novel RAG2 gene mutation associated with CID. The classification of a VUS may evolve with accumulating evidence, and additional studies are warranted to establish its pathogenicity. Proper communication between genetic counselors and immunologists, accurate documentation of patient information, increased public awareness, and precise utilization of genetic techniques are essential for optimal patient management",PubMed
Polygenic outcomes of sexually antagonistic selection,"Sexual antagonism occurs when males and females have different fitness optima for a phenotype, but are constrained from evolving to these optima because of their shared genome. We study the response of a polygenic phenotype to the onset of sexually antagonistic selection, modeling a phenotype initially under stabilizing selection around an optimum, followed by a sudden divergence of the male and female optima. We observe rapid phenotypic evolution to these new optima via small changes in allele frequencies genome-wide. We study the role of sex chromosomes in this divergence and find that, in the absence of dosage compensation, the X chromosome favors evolution toward the female optimum, inducing co-evolutionary male-biased responses on the autosomes. However, dosage compensation obscures the female-biased interests of the X, causing it to contribute equally to male and female phenotypic change. In both scenarios, we see little effect of dominance in the genetic variation utilized by the X chromosome vs. the autosomes. We go on to examine the dynamics of stabilizing selection once the male and female optima have been reached, exploring a subtle mechanism through which the X chromosome, via the Bulmer effect, can cause higher equilibrium phenotypic variance in males than females. Finally, we consider how sexual antagonistic selection might persist across longer time scales, demonstrating that random fluctuations in an adaptive landscape can generate prolonged intragenomic conflict. Overall, our results provide insight into the response of complex phenotypes to sexually antagonistic selection and the evolution of sexual dimorphism",biorxiv
Artificial Intelligence ECG Analysis in Patients with Short QT Syndrome to Predict Life-Threatening Arrhythmic Events,"Short QT syndrome (SQTS) is an inherited cardiac ion-channel disease related to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young and otherwise healthy individuals. SCD is often the first clinical presentation in patients with SQTS. However, arrhythmia risk stratification is presently unsatisfactory in asymptomatic patients. In this context, artificial intelligence-based electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has never been applied to refine risk stratification in patients with SQTS. The purpose of this study was to analyze ECGs from SQTS patients with the aid of different AI algorithms to evaluate their ability to discriminate between subjects with and without documented life-threatening arrhythmic events. The study group included 104 SQTS patients, 37 of whom had a documented major arrhythmic event at presentation and/or during follow-up. Thirteen ECG features were measured independently by three expert cardiologists; then, the dataset was randomly divided into three subsets (training, validation, and testing). Five shallow neural networks were trained, validated, and tested to predict subject-specific class (non-event/event) using different subsets of ECG features. Additionally, several deep learning and machine learning algorithms, such as Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer, MobileNetV3, EfficientNetV2, ConvNextTiny, Capsule Networks, and logistic regression were trained, validated, and tested directly on the scanned ECG images, without any manual feature extraction. Furthermore, a shallow neural network, a 1-D transformer classifier, and a 1-D CNN were trained, validated, and tested on ECG signals extracted from the aforementioned scanned images. Classification metrics were evaluated by means of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, and area under the curve. Results prove that artificial intelligence can help clinicians in better stratifying risk of arrhythmia in patients with SQTS. In particular, shallow neural networks' processing features showed the best performance in identifying patients that will not suffer from a potentially lethal event. This could pave the way for refined ECG-based risk stratification in this group of patients, potentially helping in saving the lives of young and otherwise healthy individuals",PubMed

The Case for Retaining Natural Language Descriptions of Phenotypes in Plant Databases and a Web Application as Proof of Concept,"Similarities in phenotypic descriptions can be indicative of shared genetics, metabolism, and stress responses, to name a few. Finding and measuring similarity across descriptions of phenotype is not straightforward, with previous successes in computation requiring a great deal of expert data curation. Natural language processing of free text descriptions of phenotype is often less resource intensive than applying expert curation. It is therefore critical to understand the performance of natural language processing techniques for organizing and analyzing biological datasets and for enabling biological discovery. For predicting similar phenotypes, a wide variety of approaches from the natural language processing domain perform as well as curation-based methods. These computational approaches also show promise both for helping curators organize and work with large datasets and for enabling researchers to explore relationships among available phenotype descriptions. Here we generate networks of phenotype similarity and share a web application for querying a dataset of associated plant genes using these text mining approaches. Example situations and species for which application of these techniques is most useful are discussed.

Current status of artificial intelligence methods for skin cancer survival analysis: a scoping review,"Skin cancer mortality rates continue to rise, and survival analysis is increasingly needed to understand who is at risk and what interventions improve outcomes. However, current statistical methods are limited by inability to synthesize multiple data types, such as patient genetics, clinical history, demographics, and pathology and reveal significant multimodal relationships through predictive algorithms. Advances in computing power and data science enabled the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), which synthesizes vast amounts of data and applies algorithms that enable personalized diagnostic approaches. Here, we analyze AI methods used in skin cancer survival analysis, focusing on supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. We illustrate strengths and weaknesses of these approaches with examples. Our PubMed search yielded 14 publications meeting inclusion criteria for this scoping review. Most publications focused on melanoma, particularly histopathologic interpretation with deep learning. Such concentration on a single type of skin cancer amid increasing focus on deep learning highlight growing areas for innovation; however, it also demonstrates opportunity for additional analysis that addresses other types of cutaneous malignancies and expands the scope of prognostication to combine both genetic, histopathologic, and clinical data. Moreover, researchers may leverage multiple AI methods for enhanced benefit in analyses. Expanding AI to this arena may enable improved survival analysis, targeted treatments, and outcomes",PubMed
"The clinical and genetic spectrum of paediatric speech and language disorders in 52,143 individuals","Speech and language disorders are known to have a substantial genetic contribution. Although frequently examined as components of other conditions, research on the genetic basis of linguistic differences as separate phenotypic subgroups has been limited so far.  Here, we performed an in-depth characterization of speech and language disorders in 52,143 individuals, reconstructing clinical histories using a large-scale data mining approach of the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) from an entire large paediatric healthcare network.  The reported frequency of these disorders was the highest between 2 and 5 years old and spanned a spectrum of twenty-six broad speech and language diagnoses. We used Natural Language Processing to assess to which degree clinical diagnosis in full-text notes were reflected in ICD-10 diagnosis codes. We found that aphasia and speech apraxia could be easily retrieved through ICD-10 diagnosis codes, while stuttering as a speech phenotype was only coded in 12% of individuals through appropriate ICD-10 codes. We found significant comorbidity of speech and language disorders in neurodevelopmental conditions (30.31%) and to a lesser degree with epilepsies (6.07%) and movement disorders (2.05%). The most common genetic disorders retrievable in our EMR analysis were STXBP1 (n=21), PTEN (n=20), and CACNA1A (n=18). When assessing associations of genetic diagnoses with specific linguistic phenotypes, we observed associations of STXBP1 and aphasia (P=8.57 x 10-7, CI=18.62-130.39) and MYO7A with speech and language development delay due to hearing loss (P=1.24 x 10-5, CI=17.46-Inf). Finally, in a sub-cohort of 726 individuals with whole exome sequencing data, we identified an enrichment of rare variants in synaptic protein and neuronal receptor pathways and associations of UQCRC1 with expressive aphasia and WASHC4 with abnormality of speech or vocalization.  In summary, our study outlines the landscape of paediatric speech and language disorders, confirming the phenotypic complexity of linguistic traits and novel genotype-phenotype associations. Subgroups of paediatric speech and language disorders differ significantly with respect to the composition of monogenic aetiologies

The most common genetic disorders retrievable in our analysis of electronic medical records were STXBP1 (n = 21), PTEN (n = 20) and CACNA1A (n = 18). When assessing associations of genetic diagnoses with specific linguistic phenotypes, we observed associations of STXBP1 and aphasia (P = 8.57 × 10-7, 95% confidence interval = 18.62-130.39) and MYO7A with speech and language development delay attributable to hearing loss (P = 1.24 × 10-5, 95% confidence interval = 17.46-infinity). Finally, in a sub-cohort of 726 individuals with whole-exome sequencing data, we identified an enrichment of rare variants in neuronal receptor pathways, in addition to associations of UQCRC1 and KIF17 with expressive aphasia, MROH8 and BCHE with poor speech, and USP37, SLC22A9 and UMODL1 with aphasia. In summary, our study outlines the landscape of paediatric speech and language disorders, confirming the phenotypic complexity of linguistic traits and novel genotype-phenotype associations. Subgroups of paediatric speech and language disorders differ significantly with respect to the composition of monogenic aetiologies",PubMed
Puberty Blocker and Aging Impact on Testicular Cell States and Function,"Spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) acquisition of meiotogenetic state during puberty to produce genetically diverse gametes is blocked by drugs collectively referred as  puberty blocker (PB). Investigating the impact of PB on juvenile SSC state and function is challenging due to limited tissue access and clinical data. Herein, we report largest clinically annotated juvenile testicular biorepository with all children with gender dysphoria on chronic PB treatment highlighting shift in pediatric patient demography in US. At the tissue level, we report mild-to-severe sex gland atrophy in PB treated children. We developed most extensive integrated single-cell RNA dataset to date (>100K single cells; 25 patients), merging both public and novel (52 month PB-treated) datasets, alongside innovative computational approach tailed for germ cells and evaluated the impact of PB and aging on SSC. We report novel constitutional ranges for each testicular cell type across the entire age spectrum, distinct effects of treatments on prepubertal vs adult SSC, presence of spermatogenic epithelial cells exhibiting post-meiotic-state, irrespective of age, puberty status, or PB treatment. Further, we defined distinct effects of PB and aging on testicular cell lineage composition, and SSC meiotogenetic state and function. Using single cell data from prepubertal and young adult, we were able to accurately predict sexual maturity based both on overall cell type proportions, as well as on gene expression patterns within each major cell type. Applying these models to a PB-treated patient that they appeared pre-pubertal across the entire tissue. This combined with the noted gland atrophy and abnormalities from the histology data raise a potential concern regarding the complete reversibility and reproductive fitness of SSC. The biorepository, data, and research approach presented in this study provide unique opportunity to explore the impact of PB on testicular reproductive health",biorxiv
Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis in a Critically Ill African American Woman: A Case Report Written With ChatGPT Assistance,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are life-threatening spectrum diseases in which a medication triggers a mucocutaneous reaction associated with severe necrosis and loss of epidermal integrity. The disease has a high mortality rate that can be assessed by dermatology scoring scales based on an affected total body surface area (TBSA). Sloughing of <10% TBSA is considered SJS, with a mortality of 10%. Sloughing of >30% TBSA is termed TEN, with an increased mortality rate of 25% to 35%. We present a case and management of TEN that involved >30% TBSA in a critically ill African American woman. Identification of the offending agent was difficult due to complicated medication exposure throughout her multi-facility care management. This case conveys the importance of close monitoring of a critically ill patient during a clinical course involving SJS-/TEN-inducing drugs. We also discuss the potential increased risks for SJS/TEN in the African American population due to genetic or epigenetic predispositions to skin conditions. This case report also contributes to increasing skin of color representation in the current literature. Additionally, we discuss the use of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT, OpenAI LP, OpenAI Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA) and list its benefits and errors",PubMed
Adolescent environmental enrichment induces social resilience and alters neural gene expression in a selectively bred rodent model with anxious phenotype,"Stress is a major influence on mental health status; the ways that individuals respond to or copes with stressors determine whether they are negatively affected in the future. Stress responses are established by an interplay between genetics, environment, and life experiences. Psychosocial stress is particularly impactful during adolescence, a critical period for the development of mood disorders. In this study we compared two established, selectively-bred Sprague Dawley rat lines, the ""internalizing"" bred Low Responder (bLR) line versus the ""externalizing"" bred High Responder (bHR) line, to investigate how genetic temperament and adolescent environment impact future responses to social interactions and psychosocial stress, and how these determinants of stress response interact. Male bLR and bHR rats were exposed to social and environmental enrichment in adolescence prior to experiencing social defeat and were then assessed for social interaction and anxiety-like behavior. Adolescent enrichment caused rats to display more social interaction, as well as nominally less social avoidance, less submission during defeat, and resilience to the effects of social stress on corticosterone, in a manner that seemed more notable in bLRs. For bHRs, enrichment also caused greater aggression during a neutral social encounter and nominally during defeat, and decreased anxiety-like behavior. To explore the neurobiology underlying the development of social resilience in the anxious phenotype bLRs, RNA-seq was conducted on the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens, two brain regions that mediate stress regulation and social behavior. Gene sets previously associated with stress, social behavior, aggression and exploratory activity were enriched with differential expression in both regions, with a particularly large effect on gene sets that regulate social behaviors. Our findings provide further evidence that adolescent enrichment can serve as an inoculating experience against future stressors. The ability to induce social resilience in a usually anxious line of animals by manipulating their environment has translational implications, as it underscores the feasibility of intervention strategies targeted at genetically vulnerable adolescent populations",biorxiv
PhenoSV: interpretable phenotype-aware model for the prioritization of genes affected by structural variants,"Structural variants (SVs) represent a major source of genetic variation associated with phenotypic diversity and disease susceptibility. While long-read sequencing can discover over 20,000 SVs per human genome, interpreting their functional consequences remains challenging. Existing methods for identifying disease-related SVs focus on deletion/duplication only and cannot prioritize individual genes affected by SVs, especially for noncoding SVs. Here, we introduce PhenoSV, a phenotype-aware machine-learning model that interprets all major types of SVs and genes affected. PhenoSV segments and annotates SVs with diverse genomic features and employs a transformer-based architecture to predict their impacts under a multiple-instance learning framework. With phenotype information, PhenoSV further utilizes gene-phenotype associations to prioritize phenotype-related SVs. Evaluation on extensive human SV datasets covering all SV types demonstrates PhenoSV's superior performance over competing methods. Applications in diseases suggest that PhenoSV can determine disease-related genes from SVs. A web server and a command-line tool for PhenoSV are available at https://phenosv.wglab.org ",PubMed
Evaluation of Deep Learning for predicting rice traits using structural and single-nucleotide genomic variants,"Structural variants (SVs) such as deletions, inversions, duplications, and Transposable Element (TE) Insertion Polymorphisms (TIPs) are prevalent in plant genomes and have played an important role in evolution and domestication, as they constitute a significant source of genomic and phenotypic variability. Nevertheless, most methods in quantitative genetics focusing on crop improvement, such as genomic prediction, consider Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) as the only type of genetic marker. Here, we used rice to investigate whether combining the structural and nucleotide genome-wide variation can improve prediction ability of traits when compared to using only SNPs. Moreover, we also examine the potential advantage of Deep Learning (DL) networks over Bayesian Linear models, which have been widely applied in genomic prediction. Specifically, the performance of BayesC and a Bayesian Reproducible Kernel Hilbert space regressions were compared to two different DL architectures, the Multilayer Perceptron, and the Convolution Neural Network. We further explore their prediction ability by using various marker input strategies and found that exploiting structural and nucleotide variation improves prediction ability on complex traits in rice. Also, DL models outperformed Bayesian models in 75% of the studied cases. Finally, DL systematically improved prediction ability of binary traits against the Bayesian models",biorxiv
Leveraging Generative AI to Accelerate Biocuration of Medical Actions for Rare Disease,"Structured representations of clinical data can support computational analysis of individuals and cohorts, and ontologies representing disease entities and phenotypic abnormalities are now commonly used for translational research. The Medical Action Ontology (MAxO) provides a computational representation of treatments and other actions taken for the clinical management of patients. Currently, manual biocuration is used to assign MAxO terms to rare diseases, enabling clinical management of rare diseases to be described computationally for use in clinical decision support and mechanism discovery. However, it is challenging to scale manual curation to comprehensively capture information about medical actions for the more than 10,000 rare diseases.  We present AutoMAxO, a semi-automated workflow that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline MAxO biocuration for rare diseases. AutoMAxO first uses LLMs to retrieve candidate curations from abstracts of relevant publications. Next, the candidate curations are matched to ontology terms from MAxO, Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), and MONDO disease ontology via a combination of LLMs and post-processing techniques. Finally, the matched terms are presented in a structured form to a human curator for approval. We used this approach to process 4,918 unique medical abstracts and identified annotations for 21 rare genetic diseases, we extracted 18,631 candidate disease-treatment curations, 538 of which were confirmed and transferred to the MAxO annotation dataset.  The results of this project underscore the potential of generative AI to accelerate precision medicine by enabling a robust and comprehensive curation of the primary literature to represent information about diseases and procedures in a structured fashion. Although we focused on MAxO in this project, similar approaches could be taken for other biomedical curation tasks

The DCM Project Portal: A direct-to-participant platform of The DCM Research Project,"Study ObjectiveTo develop a digital platform to conduct family-based, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) genetic research.  DesignInnovative approaches are needed to achieve large family enrollment targets. The DCM Project Portal, a direct-to-participant electronic recruitment, consent, and communication tool, was designed using prior experience with traditional enrollment methods, characteristics and feedback of current participants, and internet access of the US population.  ParticipantsDCM patients (probands) and their family members.  ResultsThe portal was designed as a self-guided, three module (registration, eligibility, and consent) process with internally created supporting informational and messaging resources integrated throughout. The experience can be tailored to user type and the format adapted with programmatic growth. Characteristics of participants of the recently completed DCM Precision Medicine Study were assessed as an exemplary user population. A majority of the diverse (34% non-Hispanic Black (NHE-B), 9.1% Hispanic; 53.6% female) proband (n=1223) and family members (n=1781) participants aged >18 years reported not at all or rarely having problems learning about their health from written information (81%) and a high confidence in completing medical forms (77.2% very much or often confident). A majority of participants across age and race-ethnicity groups reported internet access, with highest rates of no reported access in those >77 years, NHE-B, and Hispanic, which reflects patterns similar to rates reported by the US Census Bureau as of 2021.  ConclusionsDigital enrollment tools offer opportunity to improve access and efficiency. The portal is an example of a digital approach to family-based genetic research",medrxiv
Ancient biomolecules suggest learned foraging strategy in extinct cave bears,"Studying the behavioural ecology of long-extinct species is challenging due to the difficulty in measuring the behavioural phenotype and correlating this with genetic and environmental factors. However, a multidisciplinary approach integrating isotope analysis of diet and ancient DNA analysis of genetic relationships offers a potential framework to test the proximate causes of dietary preferences. Our study focuses on Late Pleistocene cave bears from the Romanian Carpathians. Stable isotope analysis of bone collagen reveals substantial lifetime variation in food plant preferences among individuals. We find that bears with similar diets do not cluster according to their population structure, sex, time period, climatic conditions, or location. This disconnect suggests that diet preference in cave bears is not genetically inherited, and instead that individuals adapted their diets based on foraging experience. This integrative approach opens new avenues for understanding Pleistocene animal behaviour, leveraging ancient biomolecules synergistically to reveal insights otherwise inaccessible",biorxiv
Genomic prediction for sugarcane diseases including hybrid Bayesian-machine learning approaches,"Sugarcane smut and Pachymetra root rots are two serious diseases of sugarcane, with susceptible infected crops losing over 30% of yield. A heritable component to both diseases has been demonstrated, suggesting selection could improve disease resistance. Genomic selection could accelerate gains even further, enabling early selection of resistant seedlings for breeding and clonal propagation. In this study we evaluated four types of algorithms for genomic predictions of clonal performance for disease resistance. These algorithms were: Genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), including extensions to model dominance and epistasis, Bayesian methods including BayesC and BayesR, Machine learning methods including random forest, multilayer perceptron (MLP), modified convolutional neural network (CNN) and attention networks designed to capture epistasis across the genome-wide markers. Simple hybrid methods, that first used BayesR/GWAS to identify a subset of 1000 markers with moderate to large marginal additive effects, then used attention networks to derive predictions from these effects and their interactions, were also developed and evaluated. The hypothesis for this approach was that using a subset of markers more likely to have an effect would enable better estimation of interaction effects than when there were an extremely large number of possible interactions, especially with our limited data set size. To evaluate the methods, we applied both random five-fold cross-validation and a structured PCA based cross-validation that separated 4702 sugarcane clones (that had disease phenotypes and genotyped for 26k genome wide SNP markers) by genomic relationship. The Bayesian methods (BayesR and BayesC) gave the highest accuracy of prediction, followed closely by hybrid methods with attention networks. The hybrid methods with attention networks gave the lowest variation in accuracy of prediction across validation folds (and lowest MSE), which may be a criteria worth considering in practical breeding programs. This suggests that hybrid methods incorporating the attention mechanism could be useful for genomic prediction of clonal performance, particularly where non-additive effects may be important",PubMed
Distinguishing clinical and genetic risk factors for suicidal ideation and behavior in a diverse hospital population,"Suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB) are major public health concerns, but risk factors for their development and progression are poorly understood. We used ICD codes and a natural language processing algorithm to identify individuals in a hospital biobank with SI-only, SB, and controls without either. We compared the profiles of SB and SI-only patients to controls, and each other, using phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) and polygenic risk scores (PRS). PheWAS identified many risk factors for SB and SI-only, plus specific psychiatric disorders which may be involved in progression from SI-only to SB. PRS for suicide attempt were only associated with SB, and even after accounting for psychiatric disorder PRS. SI PRS were only associated with SI-only, although not after accounting for psychiatric disorder PRS. These findings advance understanding of distinct genetic and clinical risk factors for SB and SI-only, which will aid in early detection and intervention efforts",medrxiv
Codon affinity in mitochondrial DNA shapes evolutionary and somatic fitness,"Summary ParagraphSomatic variation contributes to biological heterogeneity by modulating cellular proclivity to differentiate, expand, adapt, or die. While large-scale sequencing efforts have revealed the foundational role of somatic variants to drive human tumor evolution, our understanding of the contribution of mutations to modulate cellular fitness in non-malignant contexts remains understudied. Here, we identify a mosaic synonymous variant (m.7076A>G) in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded cytochrome c-oxidase subunit 1 gene (MT-CO1, p.Gly391=), which was present at homoplasmy in 47% of immune cells from a healthy donor. Using single-cell multi-omics, we discover highly specific selection against the m.7076G mutant allele in the CD8+ effector memory T cell compartment in vivo, reminiscent of selection observed for pathogenic mtDNA alleles1, 2 and indicative of lineage-specific metabolic requirements. While the wildtype m.7076A allele is translated via Watson-Crick-Franklin base-pairing, the anticodon diversity of the mitochondrial transfer RNA pool is limited, requiring wobble-dependent translation of the m.7076G mutant allele. Notably, mitochondrial ribosome profiling revealed altered codon-anticodon affinity at the wobble position as evidenced by stalled translation of the synonymous m.7076G mutant allele encoding for glycine. Generalizing this observation, we provide a new ontogeny of the 8,482 synonymous variants in the human mitochondrial genome that enables interpretation of functional mtDNA variation. Specifically, via inter- and intra-species evolutionary analyses, population-level complex trait associations, and the occurrence of germline and somatic mtDNA mutations from large-scale sequencing studies, we demonstrate that synonymous variation impacting codon:anticodon affinity is actively evolving across the entire mitochondrial genome and has broad functional and phenotypic effects. In summary, our results introduce a new ontogeny for mitochondrial genetic variation and support a model where organismal principles can be discerned from somatic evolution via single-cell genomics",biorxiv
Whole-genome sequencing of half-a-million UK Biobank participants,"Summary ParagraphWhole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides a comprehensive view of the genome, enabling detection of coding and non-coding genetic variation, and surveying complex regions which are difficult to genotype. Here, we report on whole-genome sequencing of 490,640 UK Biobank participants, building on previous genotyping1 and whole-exome sequencing (WES) efforts2,3. This advance deepens our understanding of how genetics influences disease biology and further enhances the value of this open resource for the study of human biology and health. Coupling this dataset with rich phenotypic data, we surveyed within- and cross-ancestry genomic associations with health-related phenotypes and identified novel genetic and clinical insights. While most genome-wide significant associations with disease traits were primarily observed in Europeans, we also identified strong or novel signals in individuals of African and Asian ancestries. Deeper capture of exonic variation in both coding and UTR sequences, strengthened and surfaced novel insights relative to WES analyses. This landmark dataset, representing the largest collection of WGS and available to the UK Biobank research community, will enable advances into our understanding of the human genome, and facilitate the discovery of new diagnostics, therapeutics with higher efficacy and improved safety profile, and enable precision medicine strategies with the potential to improve global health.

Mapping the aetiological foundations of the heart failure spectrum using human genetics,"Summary paragraphHeart failure (HF), a syndrome of symptomatic fluid overload due to cardiac dysfunction, is the most rapidly growing cardiovascular disorder. Despite recent advances, mortality and morbidity remain high and treatment innovation is challenged by limited understanding of aetiology in relation to disease subtypes. Here we harness the de-confounding properties of genetic variation to map causal biology underlying the HF phenotypic spectrum, to inform the development of more effective treatments. We report a genetic association analysis in 1.9 million ancestrally diverse individuals, including 153,174 cases of HF; 44,012 of non-ischaemic HF; 5,406 cases of non-ischaemic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); and 3,841 cases of non-ischaemic HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We identify 66 genetic susceptibility loci across HF subtypes, 37 of which have not previously been reported. We map the aetiologic contribution of risk factor traits and diseases as well as newly identified effector genes for HF, demonstrating differential risk factor effects on disease subtypes. Our findings highlight the importance of extra-cardiac tissues in HF, particularly the kidney and the vasculature in HFpEF. Pathways of cellular senescence and proteostasis are notably uncovered, including IGFBP7 as an effector gene for HFpEF. Using population approaches causally anchored in human genetics, we provide fundamental new insights into the aetiology of heart failure subtypes that may inform new approaches to prevention and treatment",medrxiv
Mapping the Cellular Etiology of Schizophrenia and Diverse Brain Phenotypes,"Summary paragraphPsychiatric disorders account for a substantial fraction of the worlds disease burden1, and yet the development of novel therapeutics has been notoriously slow2. Likely contributing factors include the complexity of the human brain and the high polygenicity of psychiatric disorders3-5, meaning that thousands of genetic factors contribute to disease risk. Fortunately, technological advances have enabled comprehensive surveys of human brain cell types using transcriptomes from single nuclei (snRNAseq)6-8. Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked thousands of risk loci to psychiatric disorders9-11. Here, we combined these two landmark data resources to infer the cell types involved in the etiology of schizophrenia and comparison phenotypes. This work demonstrated: 1) cell types that are concordant with prior findings about schizophrenia, 2) novel cell type associations for schizophrenia, 3) greater molecular specificity regarding schizophrenia-associated cell types than was previously available, 4) evidence that well powered genome-wide and brain-wide datasets are required for these analyses, 5) distinct cellular profiles for five brain-related phenotypes, 6) a prototype for a cell-type based classification system for psychiatric and other brain disorders, and 7) a roadmap toward drug repurposing, novel drug development, and personalized treatment recommendations. Thus, this work formalizes a data-driven, cellular and molecular model of complex brain disorders",medrxiv
The microbiota and immune system non-genetically affect offspring phenotypes transgenerationally,"Summary paragraphThe host-microbiota relationship has evolved to shape mammalian processes, including immunity, metabolism, and development1-3. Host phenotypes change in direct response to microbial exposures by the individual. Here we show that the microbiota induces phenotypic change not only in the individual but also in their succeeding generations of progeny. We found that germ-free mice exhibit a robust sebum secretion defect and transcriptional changes in various organs, persisting across multiple generations despite microbial colonization and breeding with conventional mice. Host-microbe interactions could be involved in this process, since T cell-deficient mice, which display defective sebum secretion4, also transgenerationally transmit their phenotype to progeny. These phenotypes are inherited by progeny conceived during in vitro fertilization using germ-free sperm and eggs, demonstrating that epigenetic information in the gametes is required for phenotypic transmission. Accordingly, small non-coding RNAs that can regulate embryonic gene expression5 were strikingly and similarly altered in gametes of germ-free and T cell-deficient mice. Thus, we have uncovered a novel mechanism whereby the microbiota and immune system induce phenotypic changes in successive generations of offspring. This epigenetic form of inheritance could be advantageous for host adaptation to environmental perturbation, where phenotypic diversity can be introduced more rapidly than by genetic mutation",biorxiv

By establishing omics sequencing of patient tumors as a crucial element in cancer treatment, the extensive implementation of precision oncology necessitates effective and prompt execution of clinical studies for approving molecular-targeted therapies. However, the substantial volume of patient sequencing data, combined with strict clinical trial criteria, increasingly complicates the process of matching patients to precision oncology studies. To streamline enrollment in these studies, we developed OncoCTMiner, an automated pre-screening platform for molecular cancer clinical trials. Through manual tagging of eligibility criteria for 2227 oncology trials, we identified key bio-concepts such as cancer types, genes, alterations, drugs, biomarkers and therapies. Utilizing this manually annotated corpus along with open-source biomedical natural language processing tools, we trained multiple named entity recognition models specifically designed for precision oncology trials. These models analyzed 460 952 clinical trials, revealing 8.15 million precision medicine concepts, 9.32 million entity-criteria-trial triplets and a comprehensive precision oncology eligibility criteria database. Most significantly, we developed a patient-trial matching system based on cancer patients' clinical and genetic profiles, which can seamlessly integrate with the omics data analysis platform. This system expedites the pre-screening process for potentially suitable precision oncology trials, offering patients swifter access to promising treatment options.

MM-SurvNet: Deep Learning-Based Survival Risk Stratification in Breast Cancer Through Multimodal Data Fusion,"Survival risk stratification is an important step in clinical decision making for breast cancer management. We propose a novel deep learning approach for this purpose by integrating histopathological imaging, genetic and clinical data. It employs vision transformers, specifically the MaxViT model, for image feature extraction, and self-attention to capture intricate image relationships at the patient level. A dual cross-attention mechanism fuses these features with genetic data, while clinical data is incorporated at the final layer to enhance predictive accuracy. Experiments on the public TCGA-BRCA dataset show that our model, trained using the negative log likelihood loss function, can achieve superior performance with a mean C-index of 0.64, surpassing existing methods. This advancement facilitates tailored treatment strategies, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes",arXiv
Late Diagnosis of Swyer Syndrome in a Patient with Bilateral Germ Cell Tumor Treated with a Contraceptive Due to Primary Amenorrhea,"Swyer syndrome is a special form of DSD (disorders of sex development), so-called pure gonadal dysgenesis with a karyotype 46, XY and a female phenotype. One of the most important problems in patients with DSD is the risk of gonadal tumors. We present a case of a 26-year-old patient with Swyer syndrome. The patient had primary amenorrhea and no puberty characteristics. In ultrasound imaging in the vicinity of the uterus, there were two homogeneous structures. A genetic diagnosis was also performed, which showed karyotype 46, XY. The patient underwent a bilateral gonadectomy. Histopathological examination revealed the presence of dysgerminoma in both dysgenetic gonads. The follow-up of five years now did not show any changes suspected of invasion. We concluded that the primary amenorrhea, along with the absence of development of sexual characteristics, should prompt an expanded diagnosis for disorders of sex development. Gonadal dysgerminoma should be suspected even in the absence of tumor features on ultrasound and blood laboratory tests. Early prophylactic gonadectomy could protect patients from developing tumors in dysgenetic gonads",PubMed
SylloBio-NLI: Evaluating Large Language Models on Biomedical Syllogistic Reasoning,"Syllogistic reasoning is crucial for Natural Language Inference (NLI). This capability is particularly significant in specialized domains such as biomedicine, where it can support automatic evidence interpretation and scientific discovery. This paper presents SylloBio-NLI, a novel framework that leverages external ontologies to systematically instantiate diverse syllogistic arguments for biomedical NLI. We employ SylloBio-NLI to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on identifying valid conclusions and extracting supporting evidence across 28 syllogistic schemes instantiated with human genome pathways. Extensive experiments reveal that biomedical syllogistic reasoning is particularly challenging for zero-shot LLMs, which achieve an average accuracy between 70% on generalized modus ponens and 23% on disjunctive syllogism. At the same time, we found that few-shot prompting can boost the performance of different LLMs, including Gemma (+14%) and LLama-3 (+43%). However, a deeper analysis shows that both techniques exhibit high sensitivity to superficial lexical variations, highlighting a dependency between reliability, models' architecture, and pre-training regime. Overall, our results indicate that, while in-context examples have the potential to elicit syllogistic reasoning in LLMs, existing models are still far from achieving the robustness and consistency required for safe biomedical NLI applications",arXiv
Next-generation genetic sexing strain establishment in the agricultural pest Ceratitis capitata,"Tephritid fruit fly pests pose an increasing threat to the agricultural industry due to their global dispersion and a highly invasive nature. Here we showcase the feasibility of an early-detection SEPARATOR sex sorting approach through using the non-model Tephritid pest, Ceratitis capitata. This system relies on female-only fluorescent marker expression, accomplished through the use of a sex-specific intron of the highly-conserved transformer gene from C. capitata and Anastrepha ludens. The herein characterized strains have 100% desired phenotype outcomes, allowing accurate male-female separation during early development. Overall, we describe an antibiotic and temperature-independent sex-sorting system in C. capitata, which, moving forward, may be implemented in other non-model Tephritid pest species. This strategy can facilitate the establishment of genetic sexing systems with endogenous elements exclusively, which, on a wider scale, can improve pest population control strategies like sterile insect technique","PubMed,biorxiv"
Updates in Kidney Transplantation From the 2022 Banff-Canadian Society of Transplantation Joint Meeting: Conference Report,"The 2022 Banff-Canadian Society of Transplantation Meeting in Banff, Alberta, brought together transplant professionals to review new developments across various aspects of solid organ transplantation (SOT) in Canada. Presentations included consensus recommendations from expert-led forums; experiences with new procedures and legislation; reports from public health data repositories; original clinical and laboratory research; and industry updates regarding novel technologies. Speakers referenced articles and reports published in peer-reviewed journals and online, and unpublished data and preliminary findings. All authors attended presentations in-person or virtually. Recordings of select presentations were available for later review. Summaries emphasize concepts indicated by speakers as new and clinically relevant. The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs), who experience worse outcomes of COVID-19 infection than the general population. Vaccinations demonstrate an attenuated immunological response in SOTRs yet provide meaningful protection. Monoclonal antibodies are effective for both passive immunization and treatment of COVID-19 in SOTRs. Infection control protocols have driven the development of virtual methods for clinical research, such as using home blood draws and virtual follow-up to evaluate vaccine efficacy in SOTRs; and patient care delivery, such as employing telerehabilitation post transplant. Access to living kidney donation is limited by various disincentives experienced by potential donors, which may be overcome by more efficient evaluations including a One-Day Living Kidney Donor Assessment Clinic. The International Donation and Transplantation Legislative and Policy Forum provided a means of establishing consensus guidance for organ donation and transplantation (ODT) program policy to standardize delivery across jurisdictions. The implementation of a deemed consent model for organ and tissue donation in Nova Scotia may provide insight as to whether this model indeed improves access to organs. Canada's Indigenous population experiences unique barriers to transplantation, prompting efforts for more inclusive ODT policy-making. The Pan-Canadian ODT Data and Performance Reporting System Project has defined performance quality indicators, of which iTransplant and other point-of-care software solutions may facilitate collection; however, these endeavors ultimately require information technology infrastructure that exceeds the capabilities of the existing Canadian Organ Replacement Register and Canadian Transplant Registry. Pig-to-human xenotransplantation requires genetic modification of pigs and xenoantibody testing in recipients but may yet prove viable. Serum cell-free DNA, urine biomarkers, and genetic markers offer an alternative to routine biopsy for identifying subclinical rejection. Modified perfusion temperatures and perfusion solutions with hydrogen sulfide donor compounds may improve organ preservation. Molecular compatibility tools provide another means of improving SOTR outcomes, and the Genome Canada Transplant Consortium has been examining important considerations of their implementation. We were unable to capture all presentations and topics at the meeting due to the sizable quantity and variety. Topics ultimately excluded from this summary include those in pathology including Banff Classification updates; those unique to extra-renal SOT; as well as numerous abstract and poster presentations, allied health provider forums, and business meetings. A portion of the material was presented by speakers prior to peer-review or publication. The various conference presentations summarized in this report identify methods by which individual clinicians and provincial ODT programs may improve access, delivery, and quality of SOT care in Canada, while additionally identifying gaps in the literature that investigators are encouraged to pursue",PubMed
"Phenotypic and genomic evidence for transparent cellulose, metabolic diversity, and stable cellulose production in the Acetobacteraceae","The Acetobacteraceae are a family of microbes that use sugars from fruits, beverages and fermented foods to overproduce bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), a living material with broad applications in medicine and industry. Yet, the family has few complete, contiguous genome sequences available. Here, three different strains - a high production strain NQ5, a metabolic engineering host NCIB 8034, and a new isolate DS12 from kombucha were characterized and complete de novo genomes assembled. Initial growth and yield experiments reveal a diversity of carbon source utilization profiles and BNC production rates, with NQ5 achieving the highest yield on glucose and DS12 having the narrowest utilization profile. All strains synthesize optically clear BNC. Genomic evidence assigns the DS12 isolate to Komagataeibacter nataicola, reassigns NCIB 8034 from Komagataeibacter xylinus to Komagataeibacter oboediens, and supports NQ5 as Novacetimonas hansenii. The bcs gene clusters that encode BNC synthesis are also diverse. The highest producing strain, N. hansenii NQ5, has fewer bnc copies than K. oboediens NQ5, indicating that copy number does not explain high productivity. Analysis also reveals the type and frequency of mobile genetic elements. Notably, N. hansenii NQ5 has a paucity of transposons relative to other strains, which could explain the BNC production stability of N. hansenii NQ5 in culture. Thus, this work argues that Acetobacteraceae are metabolically diverse, and provides genomic evidence explaining beneficial BNC production characteristics of N. hansenii NQ5. Therefore, this work provides evidence for selection of appropriate BNC production strains.  IMPORTANCEBacterial cellulose is an important material for biomedical applications like wound dressings. This study defines important characteristics of microbes that produce bacterial cellulose, namely their ability to process different sugars and features of their genomes that make cellulose yield more consistent. These findings will aid in the development of better bacterial cellulose production processes",biorxiv
Identification of additional body weight QTLs in the Berlin Fat Mouse BFMI861 lines using time series data,"The Berlin Fat Mouse Inbred line (BFMI) is a model for obesity and metabolic syndrome. The sublines BFMI861-S1 and BFMI861-S2 differ in weight despite high genetic similarity and a shared obesity-related locus. This study focused on identifying additional body weight quantitative trait loci (QTLs) by analyzing weekly weight measurements in a male population of the advanced intercross line BFMI861-S1 x BFMI861-S2. QTL analysis, utilizing 200 selectively genotyped mice (GigaMUGA) and 197 males genotyped for top SNPs, revealed a genome-wide significant QTL on Chr 15 (68.46 to 81.40 Mb) for body weight between weeks 9 to 20. Notably, this QTL disappeared (weeks 21 to 23) and reappeared (weeks 24 and 25) coinciding with a diet change. Additionally, a significant body weight QTL on Chr 16 (3.89 to 22.79 Mb) was identified from weeks 6 to 25. Candidate genes, including Gpt, Cbx6, Apol6, Apol8, Sun2 (Chr 15) and Trap1, Rrn3, Mapk1 (Chr 16), were prioritized. This study unveiled two additional body weight QTLs, one of which is novel and responsive to diet changes. These findings illuminate genomic regions influencing weight in BFMI and emphasize the utility of time series data in uncovering novel genetic factors",PubMed
Innovative Implementation Strategies for Familial Hypercholesterolemia Cascade Testing: The Impact of Genetic Counseling,"The IMPACT-FH study implemented strategies (packet, chatbot, direct contact) to promote family member cascade testing for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). We evaluated the impact of genetic counseling (GC) on medical outcomes, strategy selection, and cascade testing. Probands (i.e., patients with FH) were recommended to complete GC and select sharing strategies. Comparisons were performed for both medical outcomes and strategy selection between probands with or without GC. GEE models for Poisson regression were used to examine the relationship between proband GC completion and first-degree relative (FDR) cascade testing. Overall, 46.3% (81/175) of probands completed GC. Probands with GC had a median LDL-C reduction of -13.0 mg/dL (-61.0, 4.0) versus -1.0 mg/dL (-16.0, 17.0) in probands without GC (p = 0.0054). Probands with and without GC selected sharing strategies for 65.3% and 40.3% of FDRs, respectively (p < 0.0001). Similarly, 27.1% of FDRs of probands with GC completed cascade testing, while 12.0% of FDRs of probands without GC completed testing (p = 0.0043). Direct contact was selected for 47 relatives in total and completed for 39, leading to the detection of 18 relatives with FH. Proband GC was associated with improved medical outcomes and increased FDR cascade testing. Direct contact effectively identified FH cases for the subset who participated",PubMed
"Tabula Sapiens reveals transcription factor expression, senescence effects, and sex-specific features in cell types from 28 human organs and tissues","The Tabula Sapiens is a reference human cell atlas containing single cell transcriptomic data from more than two dozen organs and tissues. Here we report Tabula Sapiens 2.0 which includes data from nine new donors, doubles the number of cells in Tabula Sapiens, and adds four new tissues. This new data includes four donors with multiple organs contributed, thus providing a unique data set in which genetic background, age, and epigenetic effects are controlled for. We analyzed the combined Tabula Sapiens data for expression of transcription factors, thereby providing putative cell type specificity for nearly every human transcription factor and as well as new insights into their regulatory roles. We analyzed the molecular phenotypes of senescent cells across the entire data set, providing new insight into both the universal attributes of senescence as well as those aspects of human senescence that are specific to particular organs and cell-types. Similarly, we analyzed sex-specific gene expression across all of the identified cell types and discovered which cell types and genes have the most distinct sex based gene expression profiles. Finally, to enable accessible analysis of the voluminous medical records of Tabula Sapiens donors, we created a web application powered by a large language model that allows users to ask general questions about the health history of the donors",biorxiv
"Diagnosis and management of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Experience of the UK national diagnostic service, Sheffield","The UK National Diagnostic Service for Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDS) was established in 2009 for the rare types of EDS. Vascular EDS (vEDS) is an inherited connective tissue disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the COL3A1 gene. Associated tissue fragility affects multiple organ systems, increasing the risk of blood vessel dissection and rupture, with potentially fatal consequences. The diagnosis of vEDS has improved with advances in genetic testing, however this is most often suspected following an acute event. We provide data on the clinical features of vEDS for 180 patients (full cohort) seen in our service with confirmed molecular diagnoses. Increased awareness of this rare condition will prompt genetic testing essential to confirm the diagnosis. Outcomes are improved by early diagnosis followed by appropriate management. Fragile connective tissues make invasive procedures potentially dangerous, particularly in an emergency setting. Lifestyle advice from a young age can help acceptance and understanding of the diagnosis and inform choices. There is currently limited evidence for the use of drug therapy to reduce vascular events. We report on the incidence of vascular events in 126 patients (statistical analysis cohort) in our care and the use of medication. Our retrospective data showed that those patients on a long-term angiotensin II receptor blocker and/or beta-blocker had fewer vascular events than those not on cardiac medication who received the same lifestyle and emergency care advice",PubMed
Large language models as a diagnostic support tool in neuropathology,"The WHO guidelines for classifying central nervous system (CNS) tumours are changing considerably with each release. The classification of CNS tumours is uniquely complex among most other solid tumours as it incorporates not just morphology, but also genetic and epigenetic features. Keeping current with these changes across medical fields can be challenging, even for clinical specialists. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their ability to parse and process complex medical text, but their utility in neuro-oncology has not been systematically tested. We hypothesised that LLMs can effectively diagnose neuro-oncology cases from free-text histopathology reports according to the latest WHO guidelines. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the performance of ChatGPT-4o, Claude-3.5-sonnet, and Llama3 across 30 challenging neuropathology cases, which each presented a complex mix of morphological and genetic information relevant to the diagnosis. Furthermore, we integrated these models with the latest WHO guidelines through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and again assessed their diagnostic accuracy. Our data show that LLMs equipped with RAG, but not without RAG, can accurately diagnose the neuropathological tumour subtype in 90% of the tested cases. This study lays the groundwork for a new generation of computational tools that can assist neuropathologists in their daily reporting practice",PubMed
ChatGPT as a bioinformatic partner,"The advanced Large Language Model ChatGPT4o, developed by OpenAI, can be used in the field of bioinformatics to analyze and understand cross-reactive allergic reactions. This study explores the use of ChatGPT4o to support research on allergens, particularly in the cross-reactivity syndrome between cat and pork. Using a hypothetical clinical case of a child with a confirmed allergy to Fel d 2 (cat albumin) and Sus s 1 (pork albumin), the model guided data collection, protein sequence analysis, and three-dimensional structure visualization. Through the use of bioinformatics tools like SDAP 2.0 and BepiPRED, the epitope regions of the allergenic proteins were predicted, confirming their accessibility to immunoglobulin E (IgE) and probability of cross-reactivity. The results show that regions with high epitope probability exhibit high surface accessibility and predominantly coil and helical structures. The construction of a phylogenetic tree further supported the evolutionary relationships among the studied allergens. ChatGPT4o has demonstrated its usefulness in guiding non-specialist researchers through complex bioinformatics processes, making advanced science accessible and improving analytical and innovation capabilities",medrxiv
ProtEC: A Transformer Based Deep Learning System for Accurate Annotation of Enzyme Commission Numbers,"The advancements in next-generation sequencing technologies have given rise to large-scale, open-source protein databases consisting of hundreds of millions of sequences. However, to make these sequences useful in biomedical applications, they need to be painstakingly annotated by curating them from literature. To counteract this problem, many automated annotation algorithms have been developed over the years including deep learning models, especially in recent times. In this work, we propose a transformer-based deep-learning model that can predict the Enzyme Commission numbers of an enzyme from full-scale sequences with state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other recent machine learning annotation algorithms. The system does especially well on clustered split dataset which consists of training and testing samples derived from different distributions that are structurally dissimilar from each other. This proves that the model is able to understand deep patterns within the sequences and can accurately identify the motifs responsible for the different enzyme commission numbers. Moreover, the algorithm is able to retain similar accuracy even when the training size is significantly reduced, and also, the model accuracy is independent of the sequence length making it suitable for a wide range of applications consisting of varying sequence structures",PubMed
A RAG Chatbot for Precision Medicine of Multiple Myeloma,"The advent of precision medicine has revolutionized cancer treatment by integrating individual genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors to tailor patient care (Huang et al., 2020; Ginsburg and Phillips, 2018). However, the complexity and heterogeneity of diseases like Multiple Myeloma (MM) pose significant challenges in leveraging the vast amounts of genomic data and biomedical literature available for personalized treatment planning (Rajkumar, 2014; Rollig et al., 2015). To address this, we present an innovative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot framework that harnesses the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and state-of-the-art language models to curate and analyze MM-specific literature and provide personalized treatment recommendations based on patient-specific genomic data (Lewis et al., 2020).  Our framework integrates the BioMed-RoBERTa-base model for embedding generation (Gururangan et al., 2020) and the Mistral-7B language model for question answering (Anthropic, 2023), enabling effective understanding and response to complex clinical queries. The retrieval component is enhanced by Amazon OpenSearch Service, ensuring fast and accurate access to relevant information. A comprehensive data analysis pipeline, including exploratory data analysis, semantic search, clustering, and topic modeling, provides valuable insights into the MM research landscape, informing the chatbots knowledge base and uncovering potential research directions (Blei et al., 2003; Mikolov et al., 2013).  Deployed using Amazon Kendra, our RAG chatbot offers a user-friendly and scalable platform for accessing MM information, incorporating features such as user authentication, customizable web interface, and continuous improvement based on user feedback. The framework aims to democratize access to precision medicine by providing clinicians with a sophisticated tool for interpreting complex genomic data in the context of MM, streamlining clinical workflows, and facilitating the development of personalized treatment plans (Patel et al., 2015).  This paper presents the conceptualization, development, and potential impact of our RAG-based chatbot framework on the landscape of MM treatment and precision medicine. We argue that the synergistic integration of AI, NLP, and domain-specific knowledge marks a new era of healthcare, characterized by highly personalized, data-driven, and effective treatment modalities (Thong et al., 2021). Our framework not only advances the field of precision medicine in MM but also serves as a blueprint for the development of similar systems in other complex diseases, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life",medrxiv
Unpacking unstructured data: A pilot study on extracting insights from neuropathological reports of Parkinson's Disease patients using large language models,"The aim of this study was to make unstructured neuropathological data, located in the NeuroBioBank (NBB), follow Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability principles and investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) in wrangling unstructured neuropathological reports. By making the currently inconsistent and disparate data findable, our overarching goal was to enhance research output and speed. The NBB catalog currently includes information from medical records, interview results, and neuropathological reports. These reports contain crucial information necessary for conducting an in-depth analysis of NBB data but have multiple formats that vary across different NBB biorepositories and change over time. In this study, we focused on a subset of 822 donors with Parkinson's disease (PD) from seven NBB biorepositories. We developed a data model with combined Brain Region and Pathological Findings data at its core. This approach made it easier to build an extraction pipeline and was flexible enough to convert resulting data to Common Data Elements, a standardized data collection tool used by the neuroscience community to improve consistency and facilitate data sharing across studies. This pilot study demonstrated the potential of LLMs in structuring unstructured neuropathological reports of PD patients available in the NBB. The pipeline enabled successful extraction of detailed tissue-level (microscopic) and gross anatomical (macroscopic) observations, along with staging information from pathology reports, with extraction quality comparable to manual curation results. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to automatically standardize neuropathological information at this scale. The collected data have the potential to serve as a valuable resource for PD researchers, facilitating integration with clinical information and genetic data (such as genome-wide genotyping and whole-genome sequencing) available through the NBB, thereby enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the disease",PubMed
A transformer-based multi-task deep learning model for simultaneous infiltrated brain area identification and segmentation of gliomas,"The anatomical infiltrated brain area and the boundaries of gliomas have a significant impact on clinical decision making and available treatment options. Identifying glioma-infiltrated brain areas and delineating the tumor manually is a laborious and time-intensive process. Previous deep learning-based studies have mainly been focused on automatic tumor segmentation or predicting genetic/histological features. However, few studies have specifically addressed the identification of infiltrated brain areas. To bridge this gap, we aim to develop a model that can simultaneously identify infiltrated brain areas and perform accurate segmentation of gliomas. We have developed a transformer-based multi-task deep learning model that can perform two tasks simultaneously: identifying infiltrated brain areas segmentation of gliomas. The multi-task model leverages shaped location and boundary information to enhance the performance of both tasks. Our retrospective study involved 354 glioma patients (grades II-IV) with single or multiple brain area infiltrations, which were divided into training (N = 270), validation (N = 30), and independent test (N = 54) sets. We evaluated the predictive performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Dice scores. Our multi-task model achieved impressive results in the independent test set, with an AUC of 94.95% (95% CI, 91.78-97.58), a sensitivity of 87.67%, a specificity of 87.31%, and accuracy of 87.41%. Specifically, for grade II-IV glioma, the model achieved AUCs of 95.25% (95% CI, 91.09-98.23, 84.38% sensitivity, 89.04% specificity, 87.62% accuracy), 98.26% (95% CI, 95.22-100, 93.75% sensitivity, 98.15% specificity, 97.14% accuracy), and 93.83% (95%CI, 86.57-99.12, 92.00% sensitivity, 85.71% specificity, 87.37% accuracy) respectively for the identification of infiltrated brain areas. Moreover, our model achieved a mean Dice score of 87.60% for the whole tumor segmentation. Experimental results show that our multi-task model achieved superior performance and outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. The impressive performance demonstrates the potential of our work as an innovative solution for identifying tumor-infiltrated brain areas and suggests that it can be a practical tool for supporting clinical decision making",PubMed
Human-to-monkey transfer learning identifies the frontal white matter as a key determinant for predicting monkey brain age,"The application of artificial intelligence (AI) to summarize a whole-brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) into an effective ""brain age"" metric can provide a holistic, individualized, and objective view of how the brain interacts with various factors (e.g., genetics and lifestyle) during aging. Brain age predictions using deep learning (DL) have been widely used to quantify the developmental status of human brains, but their wider application to serve biomedical purposes is under criticism for requiring large samples and complicated interpretability. Animal models, i.e., rhesus monkeys, have offered a unique lens to understand the human brain - being a species in which aging patterns are similar, for which environmental and lifestyle factors are more readily controlled. However, applying DL methods in animal models suffers from data insufficiency as the availability of animal brain MRIs is limited compared to many thousands of human MRIs. We showed that transfer learning can mitigate the sample size problem, where transferring the pre-trained AI models from 8,859 human brain MRIs improved monkey brain age estimation accuracy and stability. The highest accuracy and stability occurred when transferring the 3D ResNet [mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.83 years] and the 2D global-local transformer (MAE = 1.92 years) models. Our models identified the frontal white matter as the most important feature for monkey brain age predictions, which is consistent with previous histological findings. This first DL-based, anatomically interpretable, and adaptive brain age estimator could broaden the application of AI techniques to various animal or disease samples and widen opportunities for research in non-human primate brains across the lifespan",PubMed
Contrastive learning-based histopathological features infer molecular subtypes and clinical outcomes of breast cancer from unannotated whole slide images,"The artificial intelligence-powered computational pathology has led to significant improvements in the speed and precision of tumor diagnosis, while also exhibiting substantial potential to infer genetic mutations and gene expression levels. However, current studies remain limited in predicting molecular subtypes and clinical outcomes in breast cancer. In this paper, we proposed a weakly supervised contrastive learning framework to address this challenge. Our framework first performed contrastive learning pretraining on a large number of unlabeled patches tiled from whole slide images (WSIs) to extract patch-level features. The gated attention mechanism was leveraged to aggregate patch-level features to produce slide feature that was then applied to various downstream tasks. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, three public cohorts and one external independent cohort of breast cancer have been used to conducted evaluation experiments. The predictive powers of our model to infer gene expression, molecular subtypes, recurrence events and drug responses were validated across cohorts. In addition, the learned patch-level attention scores enabled us to generate heatmaps that were highly consistent with pathologist annotations and spatial transcriptomic data. These findings demonstrated that our model effectively established the high-order genotype-phenotype associations, thereby potentially extend the application of digital pathology in clinical practice",PubMed
Comparative genomics of novel Bacteroides acidifaciens isolates reveals candidates for adaptation to host subspecies in house mice,"The breadth of phenotypes influenced by the gut microbiome in multicellular hosts has attracted the keen and renewed interest of evolutionary biologists.  Comparative studies suggest that coevolutionary processes may occur as hosts and their associated microbes (i.e., holobionts) diverge. The majority of studies to date however lack information beyond that of 16S rRNA gene profiling, and thus fail to capture potential underlying genomic changes among microbes. In this study, we conducted a comparative genomic analysis of 19 newly sampled Bacteroides acidifaciens isolates derived from the eastern and western house mouse subspecies, Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus. Through a panel of genome-wide association (GWAS) analyses applied to pangenomic content, structural gene rearrangements, and SNPs, we reveal several candidates for adaptation to the host subspecies environment. The proportion of significant loci in each respective category is small, indicating low levels of differentiation according host subspecies. However, consistent signal is observed for genes involved in processes such as carbohydrate acquisition/utilization (SusD/RagB, amyA and amyS) and de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis (purD), which serve as promising candidates for future experimental investigation in the house mouse as a model of holobiont evolution",biorxiv
Integrating Large Language Models for Genetic Variant Classification,"The classification of genetic variants, particularly Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS), poses a significant challenge in clinical genetics and precision medicine. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in this realm. These models can uncover intricate patterns and predictive insights that traditional methods might miss, thus enhancing the predictive accuracy of genetic variant pathogenicity.   This study investigates the integration of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPN-MSA, ESM1b, and AlphaMissense, which leverage DNA and protein sequence data alongside structural insights to form a comprehensive analytical framework for variant classification. Our approach evaluates these integrated models using the well-annotated ProteinGym and ClinVar datasets, setting new benchmarks in classification performance. The models were rigorously tested on a set of challenging variants, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art tools, especially in handling ambiguous and clinically uncertain variants.   The results of this research underline the efficacy of combining multiple modeling approaches to significantly refine the accuracy and reliability of genetic variant classification systems. These findings support the deployment of these advanced computational models in clinical environments, where they can significantly enhance the diagnostic processes for genetic disorders, ultimately pushing the boundaries of personalized medicine by offering more detailed and actionable genetic insights",arXiv
Expanded microbiome niches of RAG-deficient patients,"The complex interplay between microbiota and immunity is important to human health. To explore how altered adaptive immunity influences the microbiome, we characterize skin, nares, and gut microbiota of patients with recombination-activating gene (RAG) deficiency-a rare genetically defined inborn error of immunity (IEI) that results in a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes. Integrating de novo assembly of metagenomes from RAG-deficient patients with reference genome catalogs provides an expansive multi-kingdom view of microbial diversity. RAG-deficient patient microbiomes exhibit inter-individual variation, including expansion of opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Corynebacterium bovis, Haemophilus influenzae), and a relative loss of body site specificity. We identify 35 and 27 bacterial species derived from skin/nares and gut microbiomes, respectively, which are distinct to RAG-deficient patients compared to healthy individuals. Underscoring IEI patients as potential reservoirs for viral persistence and evolution, we further characterize the colonization of eukaryotic RNA viruses (e.g., Coronavirus 229E, Norovirus GII) in this patient population",PubMed

Particularly, the predictive power to infer molecular subtypes and recurrence events was strongly validated by cross-cohort experiments. In addition, the learned patch-level attention scores enabled us to generate heatmaps that were highly consistent with pathologist annotations and spatial transcriptomic data.

Attention mechanism models for precision medicine,"The development of deep learning models plays a crucial role in advancing precision medicine. These models enable personalized medical treatments and interventions based on the unique genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors of individual patients, and the promotion of precision medicine is achieved mainly through genomic data analysis, variant annotation and interpretation, pharmacogenomics research, biomarker discovery, disease typing, clinical decision support and disease mechanism interpretation. Extensive research has been conducted to address precision medicine challenges using attention mechanism models such as SAN, GAT and transformers. Especially, the recent popularity of ChatGPT has significantly propelled the application of this model type to a new height.

This Special Issue aims to provide a comprehensive overview and presentation of innovative researches on the application of graph attention mechanism models in precision medicine",PubMed
Automated derivation of diagnostic criteria for lung cancer using natural language processing on electronic health records: a pilot study,"The digitisation of healthcare records has generated vast amounts of unstructured data, presenting opportunities for improvements in disease diagnosis when clinical coding falls short, such as in the recording of patient symptoms. This study presents an approach using natural language processing to extract clinical concepts from free-text which are used to automatically form diagnostic criteria for lung cancer from unstructured secondary-care data. Patients aged 40 and above who underwent a chest x-ray (CXR) between 2016 and 2022 were included. ICD-10 and unstructured data were pulled from their electronic health records (EHRs) over the preceding 12 months to the CXR. The unstructured data were processed using named entity recognition to extract symptoms, which were mapped to SNOMED-CT codes. Subsumption of features up the SNOMED-CT hierarchy was used to mitigate against sparse features and a frequency-based criteria, combined with univariate logarithmic probabilities, was applied to select candidate features to take forward to the model development phase. A genetic algorithm was employed to identify the most discriminating features to form the diagnostic criteria. 75002 patients were included, with 1012 lung cancer diagnoses made within 12 months of the CXR. The best-performing model achieved an AUROC of 0.72. Results showed that an existing 'disorder of the lung', such as pneumonia, and a 'cough' increased the probability of a lung cancer diagnosis. 'Anomalies of great vessel', 'disorder of the retroperitoneal compartment' and 'context-dependent findings', such as pain, statistically reduced the risk of lung cancer, making other diagnoses more likely. The performance of the developed model was compared to the existing cancer risk scores, demonstrating superior performance. The proposed methods demonstrated success in leveraging unstructured secondary-care data to derive diagnostic criteria for lung cancer, outperforming existing risk tools. These advancements show potential for enhancing patient care and results. However, it is essential to tackle specific limitations by integrating primary care data to ensure a more thorough and unbiased development of diagnostic criteria. Moreover, the study highlights the importance of contextualising SNOMED-CT concepts into meaningful terminology that resonates with clinicians, facilitating a clearer and more tangible understanding of the criteria applied",PubMed
Prospects of evolution-based artificial intelligence models in genome-wide studies to stratify genetic risk variants in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,"The emergence of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has identified genetic traits and polymorphisms that are associated with the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Phospholipase domain-containing 3 and transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 are genes commonly associated with NAFLD phenotypes. However, there are fewer studies and replicability in lesser-known genes such as LYPLAL1 and glucokinase regulator (GCKR). With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical genetics, studies have utilized AI algorithms to identify phenotypes through electronic health records and utilize convolution neural networks to improve the accuracy of variant identification, predict the deleterious effects of variants, and conduct phenotype-to-genotype mapping. Natural language processing (NLP) and machine-learning (ML) algorithms are popular tools in GWAS studies and connect electronic health record phenotypes to genetic diagnoses using a combination of international classification disease (ICD)-based approaches. However, there are still limitations to machine-learning - and NLP-based models, such as the lack of replicability in larger cohorts and underpowered sample sizes, which prevent the accurate prediction of genetic variants that may increase the risk of NAFLD and its progression to advanced-stage liver fibrosis. This may be largely due to the lack of understanding of the clinical consequence in the majority of pathogenic variants. Though the concept of evolution-based AI models and evolutionary algorithms is relatively new, combining current international classification disease -based NLP models with phylogenetic and evolutionary data can improve prediction accuracy and create valuable connections between variants and their pathogenicity in NAFLD. Such developments can improve risk stratification within clinical genetics and research while overcoming limitations in GWAS studies that prevent community-wide interpretations",PubMed
ARGai 1.0: A GAN augmented in silico approach for identifying resistant genes and strains in E. coli using vision transformer,"The emergence of infectious disease and antibiotic resistance in bacteria like Escherichia coli (E. coli) shows the necessity for novel computational techniques for identifying essential genes that contribute to resistance. The task of identifying resistant strains and multi-drug patterns in E. coli is a major challenge with whole genome sequencing (WGS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. To address this issue, we suggest ARGai 1.0 a deep learning architecture enhanced with generative adversarial networks (GANs). We mitigate data scarcity difficulties by augmenting limited experimental datasets with synthetic data generated by GANs. Our in-silico method (augmentation with feature selection) improves the identification of resistance genes in E. coli by using feature extraction techniques to identify valuable features from actual and GAN-generated data. Employing comprehensive validation, we exhibit the effectiveness of our ARGai 1.0 in precisely identifying the informative and resistant genes. In addition, our ARGai 1.0 identifies the resistant strains with a classification accuracy of 98.96 % on Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) augmented data. Additionally, ARGai 1.0 achieves more than 98 % of sensitivity and specificity. We also benchmark our ARGai 1.0 with several state-of-the-art AI models for resistant strain classification. In the fight against antibiotic resistance, ARGai 1.0 offers a promising avenue for computational genomics. With implications for research and clinical practice, this work shows the potential of deep networks with GAN augmentation as a practical and successful method for gene identification in E. coli",PubMed

Rodents have been the primary preclinical model of focus due to their relative low cost, short gestational period, genetic manipulation strategies, and gold-standard behavioral tests. However, the potential for lack of clinical translation to non-human primates and humans is high as cross-species comparisons of the endocannabinoid system has not been evaluated. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we evaluate the relative gene expression of 14 canonical and extended endocannabinoid receptors in seven peripheral organs of C57/BL6 mice, Sprague-Dawley rats, and non-human primate rhesus macaques. Notably, we identify species- and organ-specific heterogeneity in endocannabinoid receptor distribution where there is surprisingly limited overlap among the preclinical models. Importantly, we determined there were only five receptors (CB2, GPR18, GPR55, TRPV2, and FAAH) that had identical expression patterns in mice, rats, and rhesus macaques. Our findings demonstrate a critical, yet previously unappreciated, contributor to challenges of rigor and reproducibility in the cannabinoid field, which has profound implications in hampering progress in understanding the complexity of the endocannabinoid system and development of cannabinoid-based therapies",biorxiv
Strawberry phenotypic plasticity in flowering time is driven by interaction between genetic loci and temperature,"The flowering time, which determines when the fruits or seeds can be harvested, is known to be sensitive to plasticity, i.e. the ability of a genotype to display different phenotypes in response to environmental variations. In the context of climate change, strawberry breeding can take advantage of phenotypic plasticity to create high-performing varieties adapted either to local conditions or to a wide range of climates. To decipher how the environment affects the genetic architecture of flowering time in cultivated strawberry (Fragaria xananassa) and modify its QTL effects, we used a bi-parental segregating population grown for two years at widely divergent latitudes (5 European countries) and combined climatic variables with genomic data (Affymetrix(R) SNP array). We detected 10 unique flowering time QTL and demonstrated that temperature modulates the effect of plasticity-related QTL. We propose candidate genes for the three main plasticity QTL, including FaTFL1 which is the most relevant candidate in the interval of the major temperature-sensitive QTL (6D_M). We further designed and validated a genetic marker for the 6D_M QTL which offers great potential for breeding programs, for example for selecting of early-flowering strawberry varieties well adapted to different environmental conditions.  HighlightsA GXE study of a segregating strawberry population in Europe showed that temperature is the main driver of flowering time plasticity. A genetic marker was designed for the main QTL",biorxiv
Insights into the foraging Gene's Influence on Mating Investments of Male Drosophila,"The foraging gene is a key genetic factor that modulates social behavior in insects, primarily by governing the trade-off between individual foraging and group-related activities. It has been associated with various behaviors associated with food search and resource exploitation, thereby playing a crucial role in determining the efficiency of foraging and the overall success of the collective. In this study, we investigate the critical role of the foraging gene in mediating complex interval timing behaviors, particularly mating duration, in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. By examining two distinct variant phenotypes, rover and sitter, we observe specific deficiencies in longer (LMD) and shorter mating duration (SMD) behaviors, respectively, suggesting the genes crucial influence on these interval timing mechanisms. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing and knockdown experiments, we identify the genes significant expression in key neurons involved in learning and memory. However, its impact on mating duration is not observed in these brain regions. Instead, our data reveal the genes crucial role in specific neurons expressing Pdfr, a critical regulator of circadian rhythms. Furthermore, the study uncovers sexually dimorphic expression patterns in the brain and highlights the necessity of the genes dosage in specific cell populations within the ellipsoid body for normal mating duration. These findings underscore the foraging genes pivotal role in mediating complex interval timing behaviors in Drosophila, providing valuable insights into the intricate interplay between genetics, environment, and behavior. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the genetic and neural mechanisms underlying complex interval timing behaviors, with broader implications for unraveling the function of foraging gene",biorxiv
Generative AI impact on protein stability prediction in breast cancer genes,"The functional classification of a missense variant in cancer predisposition genes is often challenging due to how rare the variant is observed in the population. When available, clinicians utilize a combination of family history, in vitro functional assays and in silico methods to infer protein function. In silico methods, such as missense predictors (predict changes in protein function) and protein stability predictors (predict changes in free energy) have been used to help classify a missense variant in accordance with the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guideline. To measure protein stability, many in silico algorithms predict stability based on the change of free energy and most accurate protein stability predictors require a wild-type protein template. In this study, we examine the use of generative AI to predict high-resolution protein structures as templates analyzed with protein stability methods to evaluate loss of function (LOF) activity in cancer predisposition genes BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 and RAD51C upon the presence of missense variant. Utilizing multiplexed assay of variant effect measurements and variant classifications from ClinVar, we find that prediction of Gibbs free energy ({Delta}{Delta}G) from AlphaFold2 (AF2) structures analyzed with FoldX predicts LOF better than experimental-derived wild type structures in the BRCT domain of BRCA1 and the DNA binding domain (DBD) of BRCA2, but not in PALB2 and RAD51C. We also find that AF2 structures in the BRCT domain of BRCA1 and DBD-Dss1 domain of BRCA2 analyzed with FoldX measure homologous DNA recombination (HDR) activity significantly better than Rosetta and DDGun3D. Our study also revealed that there are other factors that contribute to predicting loss of function activity other than protein stability, with AlphaMissense ranking the best overall predictor of LOF activity in these tumor suppressor breast cancer genes.  Author SummaryThe stability of a protein, often expressed in terms of Gibbs free energy ({Delta}{Delta}G), is a critical factor in predicting loss of function (LOF) activity when a missense variant is present. The effect is higher in haploinsufficient genes like the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 and RAD51C. Protein stability predictors that utilizes a wild-type structure to make its predictions is often limited by the availability of experimentally-derived protein structures. Here, in our study we show that generative AI, like AlphaFold2 (AF2) can predict structures similar to experimentally-derived structures with high similarity. Furthermore, protein stability tools such as FoldX, Rosetta, and DDGun3D can be used in conjunction to measure changes in stability. From our study, we find that complex AF2 structures representing the BRCT domain of BRCA1 and DBD domain of BRCA2 analyzed by FoldX predicts function significantly better than the experimentally-derived structures. However, predicted |{Delta}{Delta}G| does not predict function better than purpose-built in silico missense predictors for protein function. Overall, we find the AlphaMissense is the best predictor to predict function in these tumor suppressor breast cancer genes",biorxiv
[The regulatory relationship between RagA and Nprl2 in Drosophila gut development],"The gastrointestinal tract is the largest digestive organ and the largest immune organ and detoxification organ, which is vital to the health of the body. Drosophila is a classic model organism, and its gut is highly similar to mammalian gut in terms of cell composition and genetic regulation, therefore can be used as a good model for studying gut development. target of rapmaycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a key factor regulating cellular metabolism. Nprl2 inhibits TORC1 activity by reducing Rag GTPase activity. Previous studies have found that nprl2 mutated Drosophila showed aging-related phenotypes such as enlarged foregastric and reduced lifespan, which were caused by over-activation of TORC1. In order to explore the role of Rag GTPase in the developmental defects of the gut of nprl2 mutated Drosophila, we used genetic hybridization combined with immunofluorescence to study the intestinal morphology and intestinal cell composition of RagA knockdown and nprl2 mutated Drosophila. The results showed that RagA knockdown alone could induce intestinal thickening and forestomach enlargement, suggesting that RagA also plays an important role in intestinal development. Knockdown of RagA rescued the phenotype of intestinal thinning and decreased secretory cells in nprl2 mutants, suggesting that Nprl2 may regulate the differentiation and morphology of intestinal cells by acting on RagA. Knockdown of RagA did not rescue the enlarged forestomach phenotype in nprl2 mutants, suggesting that Nprl2 may regulate forestomach development and intestinal digestive function through a mechanism independent of Rag GTPase",PubMed
Tracking the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 variants in Nicaragua throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The global circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has been extensively documented, yet the dynamics within Central America, particularly Nicaragua, remain underexplored. This study characterizes the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in Nicaragua from March 2020 through December 2022, utilizing 1064 genomes obtained via next-generation sequencing. These sequences were selected nationwide and analyzed for variant classification, lineage predominance, and phylogenetic diversity. We employed both Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies for all sequencing procedures. Results indicated a temporal and spatial shift in dominant lineages, initially from B.1 and A.2 in early 2020 to various Omicron subvariants towards the studys end. Significant lineage shifts correlated with changes in COVID-19 positivity rates, underscoring the epidemiological impact of variant dissemination. The comparative analysis with regional data underscored the low diversity of circulating lineages in Nicaragua and their delayed introduction compared to other countries in the Central American region. The study also linked specific viral mutations with hospitalization rates, emphasizing the clinical relevance of genomic surveillance. This research advances the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolution in Nicaragua and provide valuable information regarding its genetic diversity for public health officials in Central America. We highlight the critical role of ongoing genomic surveillance in identifying emergent lineages and informing public health strategies",biorxiv
Chatbot for the Return of Positive Genetic Screening Results for Hereditary Cancer Syndromes: a Prompt Engineering Study,"The growing demand for genomic testing and limited access to experts necessitate innovative service models. While chatbots have shown promise in supporting genomic services like pre-test counseling, their use in returning positive genetic results, especially using the more recent large language models (LLMs) remains unexplored. This study reports the prompt engineering process and intrinsic evaluation of the LLM component of a chatbot designed to support returning positive population-wide genomic screening results. We used a three-step prompt engineering process, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and few-shot techniques to develop an open-response chatbot. This was then evaluated using two hypothetical scenarios, with experts rating its performance using a 5-point Likert scale across eight criteria: tone, clarity, program accuracy, domain accuracy, robustness, efficiency, boundaries, and usability. The chatbot achieved an overall score of 3.88 out of 5 across all criteria and scenarios. The highest ratings were in Tone (4.25), Usability (4.25), and Boundary management (4.0), followed by Efficiency (3.88), Clarity and Robustness (3.81), and Domain Accuracy (3.63). The lowest-rated criterion was Program Accuracy, which scored 3.25. The LLM handled open-ended queries and maintained boundaries, while the lower Program Accuracy rating indicates areas for improvement. Future work will focus on refining prompts, expanding evaluations, and exploring optimal hybrid chatbot designs that integrate LLM components with rule-based chatbot components to enhance genomic service delivery",PubMed
RelCurator: a text mining-based curation system for extracting gene-phenotype relationships specific to neurodegenerative disorders,"The identification of gene-phenotype relationships is important in medical genetics as it serves as a basis for precision medicine. However, most of the gene-phenotype relationship data are buried in the biomedical literature in textual form. We propose RelCurator, a curation system that extracts sentences including both gene and phenotype entities related to specific disease categories from PubMed articles, provides rich additional information such as entity taggings, and predictions of gene-phenotype relationships. We targeted neurodegenerative disorders and developed a deep learning model using Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) networks and BioWordVec word embeddings for predicting gene-phenotype relationships from biomedical texts. The prediction model is trained with more than 130,000 labeled PubMed sentences including gene and phenotype entities, which are related to or unrelated to neurodegenerative disorders. We compared the performance of our deep learning model with those of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and simple Recurrent Neural Network (simple RNN) models. Our model performed better with an F1-score of 0.96. Furthermore, the evaluation done using a few curation cases in the real scenario showed the effectiveness of our work. Therefore, we conclude that RelCurator can identify not only new causative genes, but also new genes associated with neurodegenerative disorders' phenotype. RelCurator is a user-friendly method for accessing deep learning-based supporting information and a concise web interface to assist curators while browsing the PubMed articles. Our curation process represents an important and broadly applicable improvement to the state of the art for the curation of gene-phenotype relationships",PubMed
A Theoretical Exploration of Artificial Intelligence's Impact on Feto-Maternal Health from Conception to Delivery,"The implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare is enhancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical setups. The use of AI in healthcare is steadily increasing with advancing technology, extending beyond disease diagnosis to encompass roles in feto-maternal health. AI harnesses Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and computer vision to analyze data and draw conclusions. Considering maternal health, ML analyzes vast datasets to predict maternal and fetal health outcomes, while NLP interprets medical texts and patient records to assist in diagnosis and treatment decisions. ANN models identify patterns in complex feto-maternal medical data, aiding in risk assessment and intervention planning whereas, computer vision enables the analysis of medical images for early detection of feto-maternal complications. AI facilitates early pregnancy detection, genetic screening, and continuous monitoring of maternal health parameters, providing real-time alerts for deviations, while also playing a crucial role in the early detection of fetal abnormalities through enhanced ultrasound imaging, contributing to informed decision-making. This review investigates into the application of AI, particularly through predictive models, in addressing the monitoring of feto-maternal health. Additionally, it examines potential future directions and challenges associated with these applications",PubMed
Evaluation for genetic disease in kidney transplant candidates: A practice resource,"The increasing availability of clinically approved genetic tests for kidney disease has spurred the growth in the use of these tests in kidney transplant practice. Neither the testing options nor the patient population where this should be deployed has been defined, and its value in kidney transplant evaluation has not been demonstrated. Transplant providers may not always be aware of the limitations of genetic testing and may need guidance on comprehending test results and providing counsel, as many centers do not have easy access to a renal genetic counselor or a clinical geneticist. In this practice resource, a working group of nephrologists, geneticists, and a genetic counselor provide a pragmatic, tailored approach to genetic testing, advocating for its use only where the genetic diagnosis or its exclusion can impact the choices available for transplantation or posttransplant management or the workup of living donor candidates at increased risk for heritable disease",PubMed
Natural history of rare diseases using natural language processing of narrative unstructured electronic health records: The example of Dravet syndrome,"The increasing implementation of electronic health records allows the use of advanced text-mining methods for establishing new patient phenotypes and stratification, and for revealing outcome correlations. In this study, we aimed to explore the electronic narrative clinical reports of a cohort of patients with Dravet syndrome (DS) longitudinally followed at our center, to identify the capacity of this methodology to retrace natural history of DS during the early years. We used a document-based clinical data warehouse employing natural language processing to recognize the phenotype concepts in the narrative medical reports. We included patients with DS who have a medical report produced before the age of 2 years and a follow-up after the age of 3 years (""DS cohort,"" 56 individuals). We selected two control populations, a ""general control cohort"" (275 individuals) and a ""neurological control cohort"" (281 individuals), with similar characteristics in terms of gender, number of reports, and age at last report. To find concepts specifically associated with DS, we performed a phenome-wide association study using Cox regression, comparing the reports of the three cohorts. We then performed a qualitative analysis of the surviving concepts based on their median age at first appearance. A total of 76 concepts were prevalent in the reports of children with DS. Concepts appearing during the first 2 years were mostly related with the epilepsy features at the onset of DS (convulsive and prolonged seizures triggered by fever, often requiring in-hospital care). Subsequently, concepts related to new types of seizures and to drug resistance appeared. A series of non-seizure-related concepts emerged after the age of 2-3 years, referring to the nonseizure comorbidities classically associated with DS. The extraction of clinical terms by narrative reports of children with DS allows outlining the known natural history of this rare disease in early childhood. This original model of ""longitudinal phenotyping"" could be applied to other rare and very rare conditions with poor natural history description",PubMed
"Integrating clinical pharmacology and artificial intelligence: potential benefits, challenges, and role of clinical pharmacologists","The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical pharmacology could be a potential approach for accelerating drug discovery and development, improving patient care, and streamlining medical research processes. We reviewed the current state of AI applications in clinical pharmacology, focusing on drug discovery and development, precision medicine, pharmacovigilance, and other ventures. Key AI applications in clinical pharmacology are examined, including machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning, and reinforcement learning etc. Additionally, the evolving role of clinical pharmacologists, ethical considerations, and challenges in implementing AI in clinical pharmacology are discussed. The AI could be instrumental in accelerating drug discovery, predicting drug safety and efficacy, and optimizing clinical trial designs. It can play a vital role in precision medicine by helping in personalized drug dosing, treatment selection, and predicting drug response based on genetic, clinical, and environmental factors. The role of AI in pharmacovigilance, such as signal detection and adverse event prediction, is also promising. The collaboration between clinical pharmacologists and AI experts also poses certain ethical and practical challenges. Clinical pharmacologists can be instrumental in shaping the future of AI-driven clinical pharmacology and contribute to the improvement of healthcare systems",PubMed
Gene-associated Disease Discovery Powered by Large Language Models,"The intricate relationship between genetic variation and human diseases has been a focal point of medical research, evidenced by the identification of risk genes regarding specific diseases. The advent of advanced genome sequencing techniques has significantly improved the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of detecting these genetic markers, playing a crucial role in disease diagnosis and forming the basis for clinical decision-making and early risk assessment. To overcome the limitations of existing databases that record disease-gene associations from existing literature, which often lack real-time updates, we propose a novel framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) for the discovery of diseases associated with specific genes. This framework aims to automate the labor-intensive process of sifting through medical literature for evidence linking genetic variations to diseases, thereby enhancing the efficiency of disease identification. Our approach involves using LLMs to conduct literature searches, summarize relevant findings, and pinpoint diseases related to specific genes. This paper details the development and application of our LLM-powered framework, demonstrating its potential in streamlining the complex process of literature retrieval and summarization to identify diseases associated with specific genetic variations",arXiv
CRISPR-GPT: An LLM Agent for Automated Design of Gene-Editing Experiments,"The introduction of genome engineering technology has transformed biomedical research, making it possible to make precise changes to genetic information. However, creating an efficient gene-editing system requires a deep understanding of CRISPR technology, and the complex experimental systems under investigation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, they often lack specific knowledge and struggle to accurately solve biological design problems. In this work, we introduce CRISPR-GPT, an LLM agent augmented with domain knowledge and external tools to automate and enhance the design process of CRISPR-based gene-editing experiments. CRISPR-GPT leverages the reasoning ability of LLMs to facilitate the process of selecting CRISPR systems, designing guide RNAs, recommending cellular delivery methods, drafting protocols, and designing validation experiments to confirm editing outcomes.

Into the Wild: A novel wild-derived inbred strain resource expands the genomic and phenotypic diversity of laboratory mouse models,"The laboratory mouse has served as the premier animal model system for both basic and preclinical investigations for a century. However, laboratory mice capture a narrow subset of the genetic variation found in wild mouse populations. This consideration inherently restricts the scope of potential discovery in laboratory models and narrows the pool of potentially identified phenotype-associated variants and pathways. Wild mouse populations are reservoirs of predicted functional and disease-associated alleles, but the sparsity of commercially available, well-characterized wild mouse strains limits their broader adoption in biomedical research. To overcome this barrier, we have recently imported, sequenced, and phenotyped a set of 11 wild-derived inbred strains developed from wild-caught Mus musculus domesticus. Each of these ""Nachman strains"" immortalizes a unique wild haplotype sampled from five environmentally diverse locations across North and South America: Saratoga Springs, New York, USA; Gainesville, Florida, USA; Manaus, Brazil; Tucson, Arizona, USA; and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Whole genome sequence analysis reveals that each strain carries between 4.73-6.54 million single nucleotide differences relative to the mouse reference assembly, with 42.5% of variants in the Nachman strain genomes absent from classical inbred mouse strains. We phenotyped the Nachman strains on a customized pipeline to assess the scope of disease-relevant neurobehavioral, biochemical, physiological, metabolic, and morphological trait variation. The Nachman strains exhibit significant inter-strain variation in >90% of 1119 surveyed traits and expand the range of phenotypic diversity captured in classical inbred strain panels alone. Taken together, our work introduces a novel wild-derived inbred mouse strain resource that will enable new discoveries in basic and preclinical research. These strains are currently available through The Jackson Laboratory Repository under laboratory code NachJ",biorxiv
Recognition of Genetic Conditions After Learning With Images Created Using Generative Artificial Intelligence,"The lack of standardized genetics training in pediatrics residencies, along with a shortage of medical geneticists, necessitates innovative educational approaches. To compare pediatric resident recognition of Kabuki syndrome (KS) and Noonan syndrome (NS) after 1 of 4 educational interventions, including generative artificial intelligence (AI) methods. This comparative effectiveness study used generative AI to create images of children with KS and NS. From October 1, 2022, to February 28, 2023, US pediatric residents were provided images through a web-based survey to assess whether these images helped them recognize genetic conditions. Participants categorized 20 images after exposure to 1 of 4 educational interventions (text-only descriptions, real images, and 2 types of images created by generative AI). Associations between educational interventions with accuracy and self-reported confidence. Of 2515 contacted pediatric residents, 106 and 102 completed the KS and NS surveys, respectively. For KS, the sensitivity of text description was 48.5% (128 of 264), which was not significantly different from random guessing (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% CI, 0.69-1.29; P = .71). Sensitivity was thus compared for real images vs random guessing (60.3% [188 of 312]; OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.15-2.00; P = .003) and 2 types of generative AI images vs random guessing (57.0% [212 of 372]; OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.04-1.69; P = .02 and 59.6% [193 of 324]; OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.12-1.94; P = .006) (denominators differ according to survey responses). The sensitivity of the NS text-only description was 65.3% (196 of 300). Compared with text-only, the sensitivity of the real images was 74.3% (205 of 276; OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.08-2.18; P = .02), and the sensitivity of the 2 types of images created by generative AI was 68.0% (204 of 300; OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.77-1.66; P = .54) and 71.0% (247 of 328; OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.92-1.83; P = .14). For specificity, no intervention was statistically different from text only. After the interventions, the number of participants who reported being unsure about important diagnostic facial features decreased from 56 (52.8%) to 5 (7.6%) for KS (P < .001) and 25 (24.5%) to 4 (4.7%) for NS (P < .001). There was a significant association between confidence level and sensitivity for real and generated images. In this study, real and generated images helped participants recognize KS and NS; real images appeared most helpful. Generated images were noninferior to real images and could serve an adjunctive role, particularly for rare conditions",PubMed
Gene-language models are whole genome representation learners,"The language of genetic code embodies a complex grammar and rich syntax of interacting molecular elements. Recent advances in self-supervision and feature learning suggest that statistical learning techniques can identify high-quality quantitative representations from inherent semantic structure. We present a gene-based language model that generates whole-genome vector representations from a population of 16 disease-causing bacterial species by leveraging natural contrastive characteristics between individuals. To achieve this, we developed a set-based learning objective, AB learning, that compares the annotated gene content of two population subsets for use in optimization. Using this foundational objective, we trained a Transformer model to backpropagate information into dense genome vector representations. The resulting bacterial representations, or embeddings, captured important population structure characteristics, like delineations across serotypes and host specificity preferences. Their vector quantities encoded the relevant functional information necessary to achieve state-of-the-art genomic supervised prediction accuracy in 11 out of 12 antibiotic resistance phenotypes.

Exploring the anti-cancer potential of SGLT2 inhibitors in breast cancer treatment in pre-clinical and clinical studies,"The link between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and an increased risk of breast cancer (BC) has prompted the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies targeting shared metabolic pathways. This review focuses on the emerging evidence surrounding the potential anti-cancer effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in the context of BC. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that various SGLT2 inhibitors, such as canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, ipragliflozin, and empagliflozin, can inhibit the proliferation of BC cells, induce apoptosis, and modulate key cellular signaling pathways. These mechanisms include the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, and regulation of lipid metabolism and inflammatory mediators. The combination of SGLT2 inhibitors with conventional treatments, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, as well as targeted therapies like phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) inhibitors, has shown promising results in enhancing the anti-cancer efficacy and potentially reducing treatment-related toxicities. The identification of specific biomarkers or genetic signatures that predict responsiveness to SGLT2 inhibitor therapy could enable more personalized treatment selection and optimization, particularly for challenging BC subtypes [e, g., triple negative BC (TNBC)]. Ongoing and future clinical trials investigating the use of SGLT2 inhibitors, both as monotherapy and in combination with other agents, will be crucial in elucidating their translational potential and guiding their integration into comprehensive BC care. Overall, SGLT2 inhibitors represent a novel and promising therapeutic approach with the potential to improve clinical outcomes for patients with various subtypes of BC, including the aggressive and chemo-resistant TNBC",PubMed
Large Language Models Need Holistically Thought in Medical Conversational QA,"The medical conversational question answering (CQA) system aims at providing a series of professional medical services to improve the efficiency of medical care. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks in various fields, such as mathematics, logic, and commonsense QA, they still need to improve with the increased complexity and specialization of the medical field. This is because medical CQA tasks require not only strong medical reasoning, but also the ability to think broadly and deeply. In this paper, to address these challenges in medical CQA tasks that need to be considered and understood in many aspects, we propose the Holistically Thought (HoT) method, which is designed to guide the LLMs to perform the diffused and focused thinking for generating high-quality medical responses. The proposed HoT method has been evaluated through automated and manual assessments in three different medical CQA datasets containing the English and Chinese languages. The extensive experimental results show that our method can produce more correctness, professional, and considerate answers than several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, manifesting its effectiveness.

On the origin and evolution of the mosquito male-determining factor Nix,"The mosquito family Culicidae is divided into two subfamilies named the Culicinae and Anophelinae. Nix, the dominant male-determining factor, has only been found in the culicines Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, two important arboviral vectors that belong to the subgenus Stegomyia. Here we performed sex-specific whole-genome sequencing and RNAseq of divergent mosquito species and explored additional male-inclusive datasets to investigate the distribution of Nix. Except for the Culex genus, Nix homologs were found in all species surveyed from the Culicinae subfamily, including 12 additional species from three highly divergent tribes comprising 4 genera, suggesting Nix originated at least 133-165 MYA. Heterologous expression of one of three divergent Nix ORFs in Ae. aegypti resulted in partial masculinization of genetic females as evidenced by morphology and doublesex splicing. It is not clear whether insufficient transgene expression or sequence divergence or both are responsible for the lack of phenotype for the other two. Phylogenetic analysis suggests Nix is related to femaleless (fle), a recently described intermediate sex-determining factor found exclusively in anopheline mosquitoes. Nix from all species has a conserved structure, including three RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs), as does fle. However, Nix has evolved at a much faster rate than fle. The RRM3 of both Nix and fle are related to the single RRM of a widely distributed and conserved splicing factor transformer-2 (tra2). RRM3-based phylogenetic analysis suggests this domain in Nix and fle may have evolved from tra2 in a common ancestor of mosquitoes. Our results provide insights into the evolution of sex-determination and homomorphic sex chromosomes in mosquitoes, and will inform broad applications of mosquito-control strategies based on manipulating sex ratios towards the non-biting males",biorxiv
The Landscape of Secondary Genetic Rearrangements in Pediatric Patients with B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia with t(12;21),"The most frequent chromosomal rearrangement in childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is translocation t(12;21)(p13;q22). It results in the fusion of the ETV6::RUNX1 gene, which is active in the regulation of multiple crucial cellular pathways. Recent studies hypothesize that many translocations are influenced by RAG-initiated deletions, as well as defects in the RAS and NRAS pathways. According to a ""two-hit"" model for the molecular pathogenesis of pediatric ETV6::RUNX1-positive B-ALL, the t(12;21) translocation requires leukemia-causing secondary mutations. Patients with ETV6::RUNX1 express up to 60 different aberrations, which highlights the heterogeneity of this B-ALL subtype and is reflected in differences in patient response to treatment and chances of relapse. Most studies of secondary genetic changes have concentrated on deletions of the normal, non-rearranged ETV6 allele. Other predominant structural changes included deletions of chromosomes 6q and 9p, loss of entire chromosomes X, 8, and 13, duplications of chromosome 4q, or trisomy of chromosomes 21 and 16, but the impact of these changes on overall survival remains unclarified. An equally genetically diverse group is the recently identified new B-ALL subtype ETV6::RUNX1-like ALL. In our review, we provide a comprehensive description of recurrent secondary mutations in pediatric B-ALL with t(12;21) to emphasize the value of investigating detailed molecular mechanisms in ETV6::RUNX1-positive B-ALL, both for our understanding of the etiology of the disease and for future clinical advances in patient treatment and management",PubMed
On the ecology of Acinetobacter baumannii - jet stream rider and opportunist by nature,"The natural reservoirs of the nosocomial pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii are not well defined. We previously identified white storks as a model system to study the ecology of A. baumannii. Having screened more than 1,300 white stork nestlings over a period of six years across different regions of Poland and Germany (overall isolation rate of [~]29.5%), including food chain analyses and environmental samplings, we come up with a detailed picture of the dynamics and diversity of A. baumannii in their natural habitats. Adult storks, rather than being stably colonized with strains of A. baumannii which are successively transferred to their offspring, instead initially encounter these bacteria while foraging. Among their common food sources, consisting of earthworms, small mammals, and insects, we identified earthworms as a potential source of A. baumannii, but more so the associated soil as well as plant roots. Through this, hotspot soil and compost habitats were identified which enable population dynamics to be studied over the course of the year. We demonstrate that sterilized plant material is rapidly colonized by airborne A. baumannii suggesting they patrol to search for novel habitats, being opportunist by nature. The prevalence of A. baumannii exhibited a strong seasonality and peaked during summer. The strains we collected in Poland and Germany represent more than 50% of the worldwide known diversity in terms of the intrinsic OXA-51-like {beta}-lactamase. A set of [~]400 genomes was determined and compared to a diverse set of publicly available genomes. Our pan-genome estimate of the species ([~]51,000 unique genes) more than doubles the amount proposed by previous studies. Core-genome based phylogenetic analyses illustrated numerous links between wildlife isolates and hospital strains, including ancient as well as recent intercontinental transfer. Our data further suggest massive radiation within the species early after its emergence, matching with human activity during the Neolithic. Deforestation in particular seemed to set the stage for this bloom as we found that forests do not provide conducive conditions for the proliferation of A. baumannii. In contrast, wet and nutrient-rich soil alongside rivers sampled during the summer can yield an isolation rate of [~]30%. Linking published work on the interaction between A. baumannii and fungi and on aspergillosis as a major cause of mortality in white stork nestlings to our findings, we hypothesized that fungi and A. baumannii share a long history of coevolution. Interaction studies revealed the capability of A. baumannii to adhere to fungal spores and to suppress spore germination. Taken together, the intrinsic resistance endowment and potential to acquire antibiotic resistance can be explained by coevolution with antibiotic-producing fungi and other microorganisms within soil, and resistance to desiccation stress and radiation can be interpreted in the light of intercontinental hitchhiking through fungal spores.  Originality - SignificanceThe ecology of the nosocomial pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii remains poorly understood outside the hospital. Here, we present the most comprehensive study on its environmental biology to date, after having collected more than 1,450 independent isolates of which around 400 were whole genome-sequenced. This study more than doubles the size of the pan-genome of the species, illustrating both the diversity of our collection and the bias of previous work, but also the bottleneck for the establishment of lineages within the hospital environment. We reached isolation rates of about 30% both in white stork (Ciconia ciconia) nestlings and in soil samples when considering for sampling all preferences of A. baumannii we uncovered. Thus, it is now possible to study the ecology and evolution of A. baumannii in nature at an unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. We describe the worldwide spread of A. baumannii lineages in nature as an ancient phenomenon that even surpasses that of human-associated bacteria in magnitude. This is likely due to airborne spread, putatively facilitated by association with fungal spores. We propose that A. baumannii is an opportunist by nature, using airborne patrolling to rapidly enter new suitable habitats consisting of organic matter in early stages of decomposition. Our collective data suggest that A. baumannii, early after its speciation, went through massive radiation during the Neolithic, likely due to deforestation, settlement and farming producing numerous favorable habitats. Their natural lifestyle, which requires rapid adaptability to various habitats as well as tolerance to desiccation, radiation and antibiotic stress, perfectly predispose these opportunistic pathogens to establish within the hospital setting. Comparison of genomes from environmental and clinical isolates will now enable studies of the adaptive evolution of environmental bacteria towards multidrug-resistant opportunistic pathogens",biorxiv
A deep network embedded with rough fuzzy discretization for OCT fundus image segmentation,"The noise and redundant information are the main reasons for the performance bottleneck of medical image segmentation algorithms based on the deep learning. To this end, we propose a deep network embedded with rough fuzzy discretization (RFDDN) for OCT fundus image segmentation. Firstly, we establish the information decision table of OCT fundus image segmentation, and regard each category of segmentation region as a fuzzy set. Then, we use the fuzzy c-means clustering to get the membership degrees of pixels to each segmentation region. According to membership functions and the equivalence relation generated by the brightness attribute, we design the individual fitness function based on the rough fuzzy set, and use a genetic algorithm to search for the best breakpoints to discretize the features of OCT fundus images. Finally, we take the feature discretization based on the rough fuzzy set as the pre-module of the deep neural network, and introduce the deep supervised attention mechanism to obtain the important multi-scale information. We compare RFDDN with U-Net, ReLayNet, CE-Net, MultiResUNet, and ISCLNet on the two groups of 3D retinal OCT data. RFDDN is superior to the other five methods on all evaluation indicators. The results obtained by ISCLNet are the second only inferior to those obtained by RFDDN. DSC, sensitivity, and specificity of RFDDN are evenly 3.3%, 2.6%, and 7.1% higher than those of ISCLNet, respectively. HD95 and ASD of RFDDN are evenly 6.6% and 19.7% lower than those of ISCLNet, respectively. The experimental results show that our method can effectively eliminate the noise and redundant information in Oct fundus images, and greatly improve the accuracy of OCT fundus image segmentation while taking into account the interpretability and computational efficiency",PubMed
Case Report: Multiple prolactinomas in a young man with Kallmann syndrome and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia,"The occurrence of prolactinomas in sex hormone treated patients with central hypogonadism is extremely rare. We present a Caucasian male patient who was diagnosed with Kallmann syndrome (KS) at age 15 years. Testosterone treatment was started. At age 26 the patient presented with mild headache. MRI revealed two separate pituitary adenomas along with the absence of the olfactory bulbs. Given the presence of marked hyperprolactinemia (17x upper limit of the reference range) the diagnosis prolactinoma was made and treatment with cabergoline was started which resulted in a complete biochemical response and in marked reduction of both adenomas in size. Hypogonadism persisted and testosterone replacement therapy was continued. Genetic testing of genes associated with pituitary tumors, Kallmann syndrome and idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was negative. Mild concomitant hypercalcemia in accordance with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) prompted mutation analysis of the calcium receptor (CASR) gene which yielded a pathogenic inactivating variant. The presence of two separate prolactinomas in a patient with KS has not yet been reported in the literature. The effect of sex hormone treatment of KS patients on the possible development of prolactinoma is unknown at present. The occurance of multiple prolactinomas in our patient suggests increased susceptibility. Although CaSR is expressed in GnRH neurons in mouse brain and CaSR deficient mice have a reduced hypothalamic GnRH neuronal population, the relevance of the CASR gene variant in our patient for the KS phenotype is unclear at present",PubMed
Identification of novel mutations in TPK1 and SLC19A3 genes in families exhibiting thiamine metabolism dysfunction syndrome,"The occurrence of thiamine metabolism dysfunction syndrome (THMD), a rare autosomal recessive condition, may be linked to various mutations found in the TPK1 and SLC19A3 genes. The disease chiefly manifests through ataxia, muscle hypotonia, abrupt or subacute onset encephalopathy, and a decline in developmental milestones achieved during the early stages of infancy. We present findings from an investigation that involved two individuals from Iran, both of whom experienced seizures along with ataxia and hypotonia. The underlying genetic causes were found with the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, which has facilitated the detection of causal changes in a variety of genetic disorders. The selection of cases for this study was based on the phenotypic and genetic information that was obtainable from the Center for Comprehensive Genetic Services. The genetic basis for the problems observed among the participants was determined through the application of whole-exome sequencing (WES). Subsequently, sanger sequencing was employed as a means of validating any identified variations suspected to be causative. The first patient exhibited a homozygous mutation in the TPK1 gene, NM_022445.4:c.224 T > A:p.I75 N, resulting in the substitution of isoleucine for asparagine at position 75 (p.I75 N). In our investigation, patient 2 exhibited a homozygous variant, NM_025243.4:c.1385dupA:pY462X, within the SLC19A3 gene. Collectively, when presented with patients showcasing ataxia, encephalopathy, and basal ganglia necrosis, it is essential to account for thiamine deficiency in light of the potential advantages of prompt intervention. At times, it may be feasible to rectify this deficiency through the timely administration of thiamine dosages. Accordingly, based on the results of the current investigation, these variations may be useful for the diagnosis and management of patients with THMD",PubMed
"Phenome-wide identification of therapeutic genetic targets, leveraging knowledge graphs, graph neural networks, and UK Biobank data","The ongoing expansion of human genomic datasets propels therapeutic target identification; however, extracting gene-disease associations from gene annotations remains challenging. Here, we introduce Mantis-ML 2.0, a framework integrating AstraZeneca's Biological Insights Knowledge Graph and numerous tabular datasets, to assess gene-disease probabilities throughout the phenome. We use graph neural networks, capturing the graph's holistic structure, and train them on hundreds of balanced datasets via a robust semi-supervised learning framework to provide gene-disease probabilities across the human exome. Mantis-ML 2.0 incorporates natural language processing to automate disease-relevant feature selection for thousands of diseases. The enhanced models demonstrate a 6.9% average classification power boost, achieving a median receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under curve (AUC) score of 0.90 across 5220 diseases from Human Phenotype Ontology, OpenTargets, and Genomics England. Notably, Mantis-ML 2.0 prioritizes associations from an independent UK Biobank phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), providing a stronger form of triaging and mitigating against underpowered PheWAS associations. Results are exposed through an interactive web resource",PubMed
RegEMR: a natural language processing system to automatically identify premature ovarian decline from Chinese electronic medical records,"The ovarian reserve is a reservoir for reproductive potential. In clinical practice, early detection and treatment of premature ovarian decline characterized by abnormal ovarian reserve tests is regarded as a critical measure to prevent infertility. However, the relevant data are typically stored in an unstructured format in a hospital's electronic medical record (EMR) system, and their retrieval requires tedious manual abstraction by domain experts. Computational tools are therefore needed to reduce the workload. We presented RegEMR, an artificial intelligence tool composed of a rule-based natural language processing (NLP) extractor and a knowledge-based disease scoring model, to automatize the screening procedure of premature ovarian decline using Chinese reproductive EMRs. We used regular expressions (REs) as a text mining method and explored whether REs automatically synthesized by the genetic programming-based online platform RegexGenerator +  + could be as effective as manually formulated REs. We also investigated how the representativeness of the learning corpus affected the performance of machine-generated REs. Additionally, we translated the clinical diagnostic criteria into a programmable disease diagnostic model for disease scoring and risk stratification. Four hundred outpatient medical records were collected from a Chinese fertility center. Manual review served as the gold standard, and fivefold cross-validation was used for evaluation. The overall F-score of manually built REs was 0.9444 (95% CI 0.9373 to 0.9515), with no significant difference (paired t test p > 0.05) compared with machine-generated REs that could be affected by training set sizes and annotation portions. The extractor performed effectively in automatically tracing the dynamic changes in hormone levels (F-score 0.9518-0.9884) and ultrasonographic measures (F-score 0.9472-0.9822). Applying the extracted information to the proposed diagnostic model, the program obtained an accuracy of 0.98 and a sensitivity of 0.93 in risk screening. For each specific disease, the automatic diagnosis in 76% of patients was consistent with that of the clinical diagnosis, and the kappa coefficient was 0.63. A Chinese NLP system named RegEMR was developed to automatically identify high risk of early ovarian aging and diagnose related diseases from Chinese reproductive EMRs. We hope that this system can aid EMR-based data collection and clinical decision support in fertility centers",PubMed
"Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Comparative Analysis of the Overlapping Molecular Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Frontotemporal Dementia","The overlapping molecular pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) was analyzed using relationships from a knowledge graph of 33+ million biomedical journal articles. The unsupervised learning rank aggregation algorithm from SemNet 2.0 compared the most important amino acid, peptide, and protein (AAPP) nodes connected to AD, ALS, or FTD. FTD shared 99.9% of its nodes with ALS and AD; AD shared 64.2% of its nodes with FTD and ALS; and ALS shared 68.3% of its nodes with AD and FTD. The results were validated and mapped to functional biological processes using supervised human supervision and an external large language model. The overall percentages of mapped intersecting biological processes were as follows: inflammation and immune response, 19%; synapse and neurotransmission, 19%; cell cycle, 15%; protein aggregation, 12%; membrane regulation, 11%; stress response and regulation, 9%; and gene regulation, 4%. Once normalized for node count, biological mappings for cell cycle regulation and stress response were more prominent in the intersection of AD and FTD. Protein aggregation, gene regulation, and energetics were more prominent in the intersection of ALS and FTD. Synapse and neurotransmission, membrane regulation, and inflammation and immune response were greater at the intersection of AD and ALS. Given the extensive molecular pathophysiology overlap, small differences in regulation, genetic, or environmental factors likely shape the underlying expressed disease phenotype. The results help prioritize testable hypotheses for future clinical or experimental research",PubMed
"Deleterious coding variation associated with autism is consistent across populations, as exemplified by admixed Latin American populations","The past decade has seen remarkable progress in identifying genes that, when impacted by deleterious coding variation, confer high risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability, and other developmental disorders. However, most underlying gene discovery efforts have focused on individuals of European ancestry, limiting insights into genetic risks across diverse populations. To help address this, the Genomics of Autism in Latin American Ancestries Consortium (GALA) was formed, presenting here the largest sequencing study of ASD in Latin American individuals (n>15,000). We identified 35 genome-wide significant (FDR < 0.05) ASD risk genes, with substantial overlap with findings from European cohorts, and highly constrained genes showing consistent signal across populations. The results provide support for emerging (e.g., MARK2, YWHAG, PACS1, RERE, SPEN, GSE1, GLS, TNPO3, ANKRD17) and established ASD genes, and for the utility of genetic testing approaches for deleterious variants in diverse populations, while also demonstrating the ongoing need for more inclusive genetic research and testing. We conclude that the biology of ASD is universal and not impacted to any detectable degree by ancestry.

Genetic counselors' utilization of ChatGPT in professional practice: A cross-sectional study,"The precision medicine era has seen increased utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of genetics. We sought to explore the ways that genetic counselors (GCs) currently use the publicly accessible AI tool Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) in their work. GCs in North America were surveyed about how ChatGPT is used in different aspects of their work. Descriptive statistics were reported through frequencies and means. Of 118 GCs who completed the survey, 33.8% (40) reported using ChatGPT in their work; 47.5% (19) use it in clinical practice, 35% (14) use it in education, and 32.5% (13) use it in research. Most GCs (62.7%; 74) felt that it saves time on administrative tasks but the majority (82.2%; 97) felt that a paramount challenge was the risk of obtaining incorrect information. The majority of GCs not using ChatGPT (58.9%; 46) felt it was not necessary for their work. A considerable number of GCs in the field are using ChatGPT in different ways, but it is primarily helpful with tasks that involve writing. It has potential to streamline workflow issues encountered in clinical genetics, but practitioners need to be informed and uniformly trained about its limitations",PubMed
Nucleotide Transformer: building and evaluating robust foundation models for human genomics,"The prediction of molecular phenotypes from DNA sequences remains a longstanding challenge in genomics, often driven by limited annotated data and the inability to transfer learnings between tasks. Here, we present an extensive study of foundation models pre-trained on DNA sequences, named Nucleotide Transformer, ranging from 50 million up to 2.5 billion parameters and integrating information from 3,202 human genomes and 850 genomes from diverse species. These transformer models yield context-specific representations of nucleotide sequences, which allow for accurate predictions even in low-data settings. We show that the developed models can be fine-tuned at low cost to solve a variety of genomics applications. Despite no supervision, the models learned to focus attention on key genomic elements and can be used to improve the prioritization of genetic variants. The training and application of foundational models in genomics provides a widely applicable approach for accurate molecular phenotype prediction from DNA sequence",PubMed
In dystrophic mdx hindlimb muscles where fibrosis is limited versican haploinsufficiency transiently improves contractile function without decreasing inflammation,"The provisional matrix protein versican is upregulated in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Versican heightens inflammation in fibrotic diseases and is involved in myogenesis. In fibrotic diaphragm muscles from dystrophic mdx mice, versican reduction attenuated macrophage infiltration and improved contractile function. We investigated the association between versican and mdx hindlimb muscle pathology, where inflammation and regeneration are increased but fibrosis is minimal. Immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR were used to assess how fiber type and glucocorticoids (-methylprednisolone) modulate versican expression. Female mdx and male versican haploinsufficient (hdf) mice were bred resulting in male mdx-hdf and mdx (control) pups. Versican expression, contractile function, and pathology were evaluated in fast extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and slow soleus muscles, excised under medetomidine-midazolam- fentanyl anesthesia.  Versican immunoreactivity was highest in soleus muscles. Versican mRNA transcripts were reduced by -methylprednisolone in soleus, but not EDL, muscles. Versican expression was decreased in soleus muscles from 6-week-old mdx-hdf mice leading to increased force output and a modest reduction in fatiguability. These functional benefits were not accompanied by decreased inflammation; muscle architecture, regeneration markers, and fiber type also did not differ between genotypes. Improvements in soleus function were lost in adult (20-week-old) mdx-hdf mice with no significant effect of versican haploinsufficiency on macrophage infiltration and regeneration markers.  Soleus muscles from juvenile mdx mice were most responsive to pharmacological or genetic approaches targeting versican; however, the benefits of versican reduction were limited due to low fibrosis. Pre-clinical matrix research in dystrophy should account for muscle phenotype and the interdependence between the fibrosis and inflammation.  NEW & NOTEWORTHYThe proteoglycan versican is upregulated in muscular dystrophy. In fibrotic diaphragm muscles from mdx mice, versican reduction attenuated macrophage infiltration and improved performance. Here, in hindlimb muscles from 6- and 20-week-old mdx mice, where pathology is mild, versican reduction did not decrease inflammation and contractile function improvements were limited to juvenile mice. In dystrophic mdx muscles, the association between versican and inflammation is mediated by fibrosis, demonstrating interdependence between the immune system and extracellular matrix",biorxiv
Is Artificial Intelligence (AI) currently able to provide evidence-based scientific responses on methods that can improve the outcomes of embryo transfers? No,"The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has raised questions about its potential uses in different sectors of everyday life. Specifically in medicine, the question arose whether chatbots could be used as tools for clinical decision-making or patients' and physicians' education. To answer this question in the context of fertility, we conducted a test to determine whether current AI platforms can provide evidence-based responses regarding methods that can improve the outcomes of embryo transfers. We asked nine popular chatbots to write a 300-word scientific essay, outlining scientific methods that improve embryo transfer outcomes. We then gathered the responses and extracted the methods suggested by each chatbot. Out of a total of 43 recommendations, which could be grouped into 19 similar categories, only 3/19 (15.8%) were evidence-based practices, those being ""ultrasound-guided embryo transfer"" in 7/9 (77.8%) chatbots, ""single embryo transfer"" in 4/9 (44.4%) and ""use of a soft catheter"" in 2/9 (22.2%), whereas some controversial responses like ""preimplantation genetic testing"" appeared frequently (6/9 chatbots; 66.7%), along with other debatable recommendations like ""endometrial receptivity assay"", ""assisted hatching"" and ""time-lapse incubator"". Our results suggest that AI is not yet in a position to give evidence-based recommendations in the field of fertility, particularly concerning embryo transfer, since the vast majority of responses consisted of scientifically unsupported recommendations. As such, both patients and physicians should be wary of guiding care based on chatbot recommendations in infertility. Chatbot results might improve with time especially if trained from validated medical databases; however, this will have to be scientifically checked",PubMed
Addressing the Gaps in Early Dementia Detection: A Path Towards Enhanced Diagnostic Models through Machine Learning,"The rapid global aging trend has led to an increase in dementia cases, including Alzheimer's disease, underscoring the urgent need for early and accurate diagnostic methods. Traditional diagnostic techniques, such as cognitive tests, neuroimaging, and biomarker analysis, face significant limitations in sensitivity, accessibility, and cost, particularly in the early stages. This study explores the potential of machine learning (ML) as a transformative approach to enhance early dementia detection by leveraging ML models to analyze and integrate complex multimodal datasets, including cognitive assessments, neuroimaging, and genetic information. A comprehensive review of existing literature was conducted to evaluate various ML models, including supervised learning, deep learning, and advanced techniques such as ensemble learning and transformer models, assessing their accuracy, interpretability, and potential for clinical integration. The findings indicate that while ML models show significant promise in improving diagnostic precision and enabling earlier interventions, challenges remain in their generalizability, interpretability, and ethical deployment. This research concludes by outlining future directions aimed at enhancing the clinical utility of ML models in dementia detection, emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration and ethically sound frameworks to improve early detection and intervention strategies for Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia",arXiv
Immunological assessment of a patient with Omenn syndrome resulting from compound heterozygous mutations in the RAG1 gene,"The recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1) is essential for V(D)J recombination during T- and B-cell development. In this study, we presented a case study of a 41-day-old female infant who exhibited symptoms of generalized erythroderma, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and recurrent infections including suppurative meningitis and septicemia. The patient showed a T<sup>+</sup>B<sup>-</sup>NK<sup>+</sup> immunophenotype. We observed an impaired thymic output, as indicated by reduced levels of naive T cells and sjTRECs, coupled with a restricted TCR repertoire. Additionally, T-cell CFSE proliferation was impaired, indicating a suboptimal T-cell response. Notably, our data further revealed that T cells were in an activated state. Genetic analysis revealed a previously reported compound heterozygous mutation (c. 1186C > T, p. R396C; c. 1210C > T, p. R404W) in the RAG1 gene. Structural analysis of RAG1 suggested that the R396C mutation might lead to the loss of hydrogen bonds with neighboring amino acids. These findings contribute to our understanding of RAG1 deficiency and may have implications for the development of novel therapies for patients with this condition",PubMed
Evaluation of face validity and core concepts of a novel knowledge scale for inherited heart disease: A pilot study,"The rising demand for genetic counseling has prompted the implementation of various innovative service delivery models, such as patient webinars, videos, chatbots, and the integration of genetic testing into mainstream healthcare. To ensure patients receive adequate information for informed decision-making, validated measures to assess these models are essential but currently limited in the setting of inherited heart disease. We aimed to develop and initiate validation of a cardiac knowledge scale, as part of the Multidimensional Model of Informed Choice measure, to assess whether patients (probands and family members) with inherited cardiomyopathies, arrhythmias, and aortopathies are provided with sufficient knowledge to make informed decisions about genetic testing. Content expert genetic counselors identified eight core concepts addressed during genetic counseling sessions; from these, eight true/false knowledge questions were created. Questions were reviewed by 22 international cardiac genetics counselors with additional changes made. Initial validation steps of the knowledge scale were conducted at two sites: the Edmonton Medical Genetic Clinic, University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton, Canada, and the Genetic Heart Disease Clinic, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, Australia. Face validity was evaluated through nine patient interviews, resulting in minor revisions to four questions and major revisions to one question. An additional five patient interviews were conducted to evaluate the revised questions. The core concepts addressed in each question were further evaluated in the context of patient decision-making about genetic testing. All participants described the eight concepts as either helpful or essential in their decision-making process. The cardiac knowledge scale is a promising measure created to evaluate the informed choice of patients and their families affected by an inherited heart condition. The next step of validation includes trialing the cardiac knowledge scale with a real-world sample of patients deciding about genetic testing for inherited heart disease",PubMed
Towards Democratization of Subspeciality Medical Expertise,"The scarcity of subspecialist medical expertise, particularly in rare, complex and life-threatening diseases, poses a significant challenge for healthcare delivery. This issue is particularly acute in cardiology where timely, accurate management determines outcomes. We explored the potential of AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a large language model (LLM)-based experimental AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue, to potentially augment and support clinical decision-making in this challenging context. We curated a real-world dataset of 204 complex cases from a subspecialist cardiology practice, including results for electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, cardiac MRI, genetic tests, and cardiopulmonary stress tests. We developed a ten-domain evaluation rubric used by subspecialists to evaluate the quality of diagnosis and clinical management plans produced by general cardiologists or AMIE, the latter enhanced with web-search and self-critique capabilities. AMIE was rated superior to general cardiologists for 5 of the 10 domains (with preference ranging from 9% to 20%), and equivalent for the rest. Access to AMIE's response improved cardiologists' overall response quality in 63.7% of cases while lowering quality in just 3.4%. Cardiologists' responses with access to AMIE were superior to cardiologist responses without access to AMIE for all 10 domains. Qualitative examinations suggest AMIE and general cardiologist could complement each other, with AMIE thorough and sensitive, while general cardiologist concise and specific. Overall, our results suggest that specialized medical LLMs have the potential to augment general cardiologists' capabilities by bridging gaps in subspecialty expertise, though further research and validation are essential for wide clinical utility",arXiv
Expansion of clinical genetic testing since the completion of the human genome project,"The sequencing of the first human genome led to expectations of the widespread use of genetics in medicine. However, assessing the true impact of genetic testing on clinical practice is challenging due to the lack of integration in the electronic health record (EHR). We extracted clinical genetic tests from the EHRs of over 1.8 million patients seen at Vanderbilt University Medical Center from 2002 to 2022, using both automated and manual methods. Using these data, we quantified the extent of clinical genetic testing in healthcare and described how testing patterns have changed over time, including utilization rate, test comprehensiveness, diagnoses made, and the number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) returned.  We also assessed genetic testing rates across medical specialties and introduce a measure - the genetic attributed fraction (GAF) - to compute the proportion of observed phenotypes attributable to a genetic diagnosis. We identified 104,392 tests, 32% of which were only reported in unstructured text, and 19,032 molecularly confirmed diagnoses or risk factors. The proportion of patients genetic testing recorded in their EHRs from 1.0% in 2002 to 6.1% in 2022, and testing became more comprehensive with the growing use of multigene panels. This corresponded with a substantial increase in the variety of diseases diagnosed with genetic testing, from 51 unique diseases in 2002 to 509 in 2022, alongside a growing number of VUS.  The phenome-wide GAF for 6,505,620 diagnoses made in 2022 was 0.46%, with 74 phenotypes having a GAF greater than 5%, including pancreatic insufficiency (67%), chorea (64%), atrial septal defect (24%), Microcephaly (17%), paraganglioma (17%), and ovarian cancer (6.8%). Our study provides a comprehensive quantification of the increasing role of genetic testing at a major academic medical institution. These results demonstrate the now pervasive use of genetic testing across diverse medical contexts and its growing utility in explaining observed medical phenome",medrxiv
A Unifying Hypothesis for the Genome Dynamics Proposed to Underlie Neuropsychiatric Phenotypes,"The sheer number of gene variants and the extent of the observed clinical and molecular heterogeneity recorded in neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) could be due to the magnified downstream effects initiated by a smaller group of genomic higher-order alterations in response to endogenous or environmental stress. Chromosomal common fragile sites (CFS) are functionally linked with microRNAs, gene copy number variants (CNVs), sub-microscopic deletions and duplications of DNA, rare single-nucleotide variants (SNVs/SNPs), and small insertions/deletions (indels), as well as chromosomal translocations, gene duplications, altered methylation, microRNA and L1 transposon activity, and 3-D chromosomal topology characteristics. These genomic structural features have been linked with various NPDs in mostly isolated reports and have usually only been viewed as areas harboring potential candidate genes of interest. The suggestion to use a higher level entry point (the 'fragilome' and associated features) activated by a central mechanism ('stress') for studying NPD genetics has the potential to unify the existing vast number of different observations in this field. This approach may explain the continuum of gene findings distributed between affected and unaffected individuals, the clustering of NPD phenotypes and overlapping comorbidities, the extensive clinical and molecular heterogeneity, and the association with certain other medical disorders",PubMed
Predicting BRCA mutation and stratifying targeted therapy response using multimodal learning: a multicenter study,"The status of BRCA1/2 genes plays a crucial role in the treatment decision-making process for multiple cancer types. However, due to high costs and limited resources, a demand for BRCA1/2 genetic testing among patients is currently unmet. Notably, not all patients with BRCA1/2 mutations achieve favorable outcomes with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi), indicating the necessity for risk stratification. In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a multimodal model for predicting BRCA1/2 gene status and prognosis with PARPi treatment. We included 1695 slides from 1417 patients with ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers across three independent cohorts. Using a self-attention mechanism, we constructed a multi-instance attention model (MIAM) to detect BRCA1/2 gene status from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) pathological images. We further combined tissue features from the MIAM model, cell features, and clinical factors (the MIAM-C model) to predict BRCA1/2 mutations and progression-free survival (PFS) with PARPi therapy. Model performance was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Morphological features contributing to MIAM-C were analyzed for interpretability. Across the four cancer types, MIAM-C outperformed the deep learning-based MIAM in identifying the BRCA1/2 genotype. Interpretability analysis revealed that high-attention regions included high-grade tumors and lymphocytic infiltration, which correlated with BRCA1/2 mutations. Notably, high lymphocyte ratios appeared characteristic of BRCA1/2 mutations. Furthermore, MIAM-C predicted PARPi therapy response (log-rank p < 0.05) and served as an independent prognostic factor for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer (p < 0.05, hazard ratio:0.4, 95% confidence interval: 0.16-0.99). The MIAM-C model accurately detected BRCA1/2 gene status and effectively stratified prognosis for patients with BRCA1/2 mutations",PubMed
"Insights on reproduction-related genes in the striped fruit fly, Zeugodacus scutellata (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae)","The striped fruit fly, Zeugodacus scutellata is a significant pest in East and Southeast Asia by damaging Cucurbitaceae blossoms and fruits. To control this pest, a novel strategy to suppress the gene(s) associated with sexually dimorphic phenotypes has been devised and implemented in a laboratory scale. However, comprehensive transcriptomic analysis related to this sex differentiation of Z. scutellata was necessary to determine effective target genes for the genetic control. We performed de novo assembly of the transcript obtained by paired-end sequencing using an Illumina HiSeq platform and let to 217,967 unigenes (i.e., unique genes) with a minimum length of 200 bp. The female produced 31, 604, 442 reads with 97.93% of Q20, 94.76% of Q30, and the male produced 130, 592, 828 reads with 97.93% of Q20 and 94.76 of Q30%. The differentially expressed genes were used to predict genetic factors associated with sex differentiation, which included Rho1, extra-macrochaetae (emc), hopscotch (hop), doublesex (dsx), sex-lethal (sxl), transformer-2 (tra-2), testis-specific serine/threonine-protein kinase (tssk1), tektin1 (tkt1) and 2 (tkt2), odorant binding proteins (OBPs), fruitless (fru), vitellogenin receptor, and hormone receptors in Z. scutellata. In addition, this transcriptome analysis provides the additional gene associated with sex determination and mating behaviors, which would be applied to develop a novel sterile insect technique against Z. scutellata",PubMed
Mutual modulation of gut microbiota and the immune system in type 1 diabetes models,"The transgenic 116C-NOD mouse strain exhibits a prevalent Th17 phenotype, and reduced type 1 diabetes (T1D) compared to non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. A cohousing experiment between both models revealed lower T1D incidence in NOD mice cohoused with 116C-NOD, associated with gut microbiota changes, reduced intestinal permeability, shifts in T and B cell subsets, and a transition from Th1 to Th17 responses. Distinct gut bacterial signatures were linked to T1D in each group. Using a RAG-2<sup>-/-</sup> genetic background, we found that T cell alterations promoted segmented filamentous bacteria proliferation in young NOD and 116C-NOD, as well as in immunodeficient NOD.RAG-2<sup>-/-</sup> and 116C-NOD.RAG-2<sup>-/-</sup> mice across all ages. Bifidobacterium colonization depended on lymphocytes and thrived in a non-diabetogenic environment. Additionally, 116C-NOD B cells in 116C-NOD.RAG-2<sup>-/-</sup> mice enriched the gut microbiota in Adlercreutzia and reduced intestinal permeability. Collectively, these results indicate reciprocal modulation between gut microbiota and the immune system in rodent T1D models",PubMed
Applications of artificial intelligence in clinical laboratory genomics,"The transition from analog to digital technologies in clinical laboratory genomics is ushering in an era of ""big data"" in ways that will exceed human capacity to rapidly and reproducibly analyze those data using conventional approaches. Accurately evaluating complex molecular data to facilitate timely diagnosis and management of genomic disorders will require supportive artificial intelligence methods. These are already being introduced into clinical laboratory genomics to identify variants in DNA sequencing data, predict the effects of DNA variants on protein structure and function to inform clinical interpretation of pathogenicity, link phenotype ontologies to genetic variants identified through exome or genome sequencing to help clinicians reach diagnostic answers faster, correlate genomic data with tumor staging and treatment approaches, utilize natural language processing to identify critical published medical literature during analysis of genomic data, and use interactive chatbots to identify individuals who qualify for genetic testing or to provide pre-test and post-test education. With careful and ethical development and validation of artificial intelligence for clinical laboratory genomics, these advances are expected to significantly enhance the abilities of geneticists to translate complex data into clearly synthesized information for clinicians to use in managing the care of their patients at scale",PubMed

Closed-Form Test Functions for Biophysical Sequence Optimization Algorithms,"There is a growing body of work seeking to replicate the success of machine learning (ML) on domains like computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) to applications involving biophysical data. One of the key ingredients of prior successes in CV and NLP was the broad acceptance of difficult benchmarks that distilled key subproblems into approachable tasks that any junior researcher could investigate, but good benchmarks for biophysical domains are rare. This scarcity is partially due to a narrow focus on benchmarks which simulate biophysical data; we propose instead to carefully abstract biophysical problems into simpler ones with key geometric similarities. In particular we propose a new class of closed-form test functions for biophysical sequence optimization, which we call Ehrlich functions. We provide empirical results demonstrating these functions are interesting objects of study and can be non-trivial to solve with a standard genetic optimization baseline",arXiv
Infant with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma identified postmortem with homozygous founder Slavic RAG1 variant: a case report and literature review,"There is an increased risk of lymphomas in inborn errors of immunity (IEI); however, germline genetic testing is rarely used in oncological patients, even in those with early onset of cancer. Our study focuses on a child with a recombination-activating gene 1 (RAG1) deficiency who was identified through a screening program for Slavic founder genetic variants among patients who died with malignancy at an early age in Belarus. We identified one homozygous founder RAG1 variant out of 24 available DNA samples from 71 patients who developed lymphoma aged <3 years from the Belarusian cancer registry between 1986 and 2023. Our patient had an episode of pneumonia at 3 months of age and was hospitalized for respiratory distress, candida-positive lung disease, and lymphadenopathy at 14 months of age. The diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was established. The patient had a normal lymphocyte count that decreased over time. One month after chemotherapy initiation, the patient died due to sepsis and multiple organ failure without a genetic diagnosis. In a retrospective analysis, T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and kappa-deleting recombination excision circles (KRECs) were undetectable in peripheral blood. A targeted screening program designed to detect a Slavic founder variant in the RAG1 gene among children revealed a 14-month-old Belarusian male infant with low TREC levels who died of EBV-driven DLBCL and complications of chemotherapy including infections. This case highlights how patients with IEI and recurrent infections may develop serious non-infectious complications, such as fatal malignancy. It also emphasizes the importance of early identification, such as newborn screening for severe combined immune deficiency. Earlier diagnosis of RAG deficiency could have prompted hematopoietic stem cell transplant well before the DLBCL occurrence. This likely would impact the onset and/or management strategies for the cancer",PubMed
Use of topic modeling to assess research trends in the journal Gynecologic Oncology,"There is scant research identifying thematic trends within medical research. This work may provide insight into how a given field values certain topics. We assessed the feasibility of using a machine learning approach to determine the most common research themes published in Gynecologic Oncology over a thirty-year period and to subsequently evaluate how interest in these topics changed over time. We retrieved the abstracts of all original research published in Gynecologic Oncology from 1990 to 2020 using PubMed. Abstract text was processed through a natural language processing algorithm and clustered into topical themes using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) prior to manual labeling. Topics were investigated for temporal trends. We retrieved 12,586 original research articles, of which 11,217 were evaluable for subsequent analysis. Twenty-three research topics were selected at the completion of topic modeling. The topics of basic science genetics, epidemiologic methods, and chemotherapy experienced the greatest increase over the time period, while postoperative outcomes, reproductive age cancer management, and cervical dysplasia experienced the greatest decline. Interest in basic science research remained relatively constant. Topics were additionally reviewed for words indicative of either surgical or medical therapy. Both surgical and medical topics saw increasing interest, with surgical topics experiencing a greater increase and representing a higher proportion of published topics. Topic modeling, a type of unsupervised machine learning, was successfully used to identify trends in research themes. The application of this technique provided insight into how the field of gynecologic oncology values the components of its scope of practice and therefore how it may choose to allocate grant funding, disseminate research, and participate in the public discourse",PubMed
Naturally segregating genetic variants contribute to thermal tolerance in a D. melanogaster model system,"Thermal tolerance is a fundamental physiological complex trait for survival in many species. For example, everyday tasks such as foraging, finding a mate, and avoiding predation, are highly dependent on how well an organism can tolerate extreme temperatures. Understanding the general architecture of the natural variants of the genes that control this trait is of high importance if we want to better comprehend how this trait evolves in natural populations. Here, we take a multipronged approach to further dissect the genetic architecture that controls thermal tolerance in natural populations using the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR) as a model system. First, we used quantitative genetics and Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping to identify major effect regions within the genome that influences thermal tolerance, then integrated RNA-sequencing to identify differences in gene expression, and lastly, we used the RNAi system to 1) alter tissue-specific gene expression and 2) functionally validate our findings. This powerful integration of approaches not only allows for the identification of the genetic basis of thermal tolerance but also the physiology of thermal tolerance in a natural population, which ultimately elucidates thermal tolerance through a fitness-associated lens",biorxiv
Anesthetic Management of a Patient With Juvenile Hyaline Fibromatosis: A Case Report Written With the Assistance of the Large Language Model ChatGPT,"This case report was written with the assistance of the large language model known as ChatGPT, a form of generative artificial intelligence that can write grammatically correct and semantically meaningful prose on a multitude of topics. Here, it has assisted us in presenting a case of anesthetic management for a case of Juvenile Hyaline Fibromatosis (JHF), an extremely rare genetic disorder that is part of a spectrum of diseases presently characterized as Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome (HFS), which also includes a more severe variant presenting in infancy. HFS is caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the ANTXR2 (anthrax toxin receptor cell adhesion molecule 2) gene, which binds collagen IV and laminin, suggesting that it may be involved in extracellular matrix adhesion. Defects in this molecule lead to abnormal deposition of hyaline material in perivascular areas, presenting as cutaneous lesions, joint contractures, and in some cases internal organ dysfunction. Anesthetic management of patients with JHF may present difficulties with patient positioning and airway management. Most reports of anesthetic management concern children with severe disease and adult reports are uncommon. We present a case of JHF in a 39-year-old woman managed for resection of a lower extremity cutaneous lesion. The anesthetic management of this relatively minor case was uneventful, but the process of drafting this report with the assistance of the new software tool ChatGPT was informative of both its strengths and limitations",PubMed
OpenAI o1-Preview vs. ChatGPT in Healthcare: A New Frontier in Medical AI Reasoning,"This editorial explores the recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence with the newly-released OpenAI o1-Preview, comparing its capabilities to the traditional ChatGPT (GPT-4) model, particularly in the context of healthcare. While ChatGPT has shown many applications for general medical advice and patient interactions, OpenAI o1-Preview introduces new features with advanced reasoning skills using a chain of thought processes that could enable users to tackle more complex medical queries such as genetic disease discovery, multi-system or complex disease care, and medical research support. The article explores some of the new model's potential and other aspects that may affect its usage, like slower response times due to its extensive reasoning approach yet highlights its potential for reducing hallucinations and offering more accurate outputs for complex medical problems. Ethical challenges, data diversity, access equity, and transparency are also discussed, identifying key areas for future research, including optimizing the use of both models in tandem for healthcare applications. The editorial concludes by advocating for collaborative exploration of all large language models (LLMs), including the novel OpenAI o1-Preview, to fully utilize their transformative potential in medicine and healthcare delivery. This model, with its advanced reasoning capabilities, presents an opportunity to empower healthcare professionals, policymakers, and computer scientists to work together in transforming patient care, accelerating medical research, and enhancing healthcare outcomes. By optimizing the use of several LLM models in tandem, healthcare systems may enhance efficiency and precision, as well as mitigate previous LLM challenges, such as ethical concerns, access disparities, and technical limitations, steering to a new era of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven healthcare",PubMed

Enhanced family history-based algorithms increase the identification of individuals meeting criteria for genetic testing of hereditary cancer syndromes but would not reduce disparities on their own,"This study aimed to 1) investigate algorithm enhancements for identifying patients eligible for genetic testing of hereditary cancer syndromes using family history data from electronic health records (EHRs); and 2) assess their impact on relative differences across sex, race, ethnicity, and language preference. The study used EHR data from a tertiary academic medical center. A baseline rule-base algorithm, relying on structured family history data (structured data; SD), was enhanced using a natural language processing (NLP) component and a relaxed criteria algorithm (partial match [PM]). The identification rates and differences were analyzed considering sex, race, ethnicity, and language preference. Among 120,007 patients aged 25-60, detection rate differences were found across all groups using the SD (all P < 0.001). Both enhancements increased identification rates; NLP led to a 1.9 % increase and the relaxed criteria algorithm (PM) led to an 18.5 % increase (both P < 0.001). Combining SD with NLP and PM yielded a 20.4 % increase (P < 0.001). Similar increases were observed within subgroups. Relative differences persisted across most categories for the enhanced algorithms, with disproportionately higher identification of patients who are White, Female, non-Hispanic, and whose preferred language is English. Algorithm enhancements increased identification rates for patients eligible for genetic testing of hereditary cancer syndromes, regardless of sex, race, ethnicity, and language preference. However, differences in identification rates persisted, emphasizing the need for additional strategies to reduce disparities such as addressing underlying biases in EHR family health information and selectively applying algorithm enhancements for disadvantaged populations. Systematic assessment of differences in algorithm performance across population subgroups should be incorporated into algorithm development processes",PubMed
Trio-Based Whole-Genome Sequencing for Critically Ill Pediatric Patients in Korea,"This study aimed to implement genome sequencing using an automated pipeline for critically ill pediatric patients within a real-world healthcare system. Twenty patients under 36 months of age, admitted to the NICU/PICU or suspected of having rapidly progressive genetic disorders, were enrolled. Trio-based genome sequencing was performed using an optimized processing pipeline, which automatically performed mapping, variant calling, annotation, and in silico pathogenicity assessment. Among 20 enrolled patients, 11 (55%) were from the NICU, and 16 (80%) presented with neurological manifestations as their chief complaint. The median time from symptom onset to study enrollment was 73 days for 18 patients referred from other hospitals and less than a week for 2 in-hospital patients. The median turnaround time (TAT) for rWGS was 10 days, with the shortest being 5 days. A definite or presumed genetic diagnosis was made in 11 patients (55%), including 10 of 16 with neurological symptoms (62.5%) and 1 of 4 with non-neurologic symptoms (25%). Management plans were modified for 8 of the 11 patients (72.7%), including medication changes, diet modifications, and preimplantation genetic testing for future pregnancies. This study highlights the feasibility and clinical utility of WGS in critically ill pediatric patients in Korea, demonstrating a high diagnostic yield and significant impact on patient management, particularly among those presenting with neurologic symptoms. Establishing a nationwide fast-track system and providing detailed testing indications are required for effective implementation. Further automation and resource optimization could reduce the TAT and improve the efficacy of rWGS in critical care settings",medrxiv
Harnessing explainable artificial intelligence for patient-to-clinical-trial matching: A proof-of-concept pilot study using phase I oncology trials,"This study aims to develop explainable AI methods for matching patients with phase 1 oncology clinical trials using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to address challenges in patient recruitment for improved efficiency in drug development. A prototype system based on modern NLP techniques has been developed to match patient records with phase 1 oncology clinical trial protocols. Four criteria are considered for the matching: cancer type, performance status, genetic mutation, and measurable disease. The system outputs a summary matching score along with explanations of the evidence. The outputs of the AI system were evaluated against the ground truth matching results provided by the domain expert on a dataset of twelve synthesized dummy patient records and six clinical trial protocols. The system achieved a precision of 73.68%, sensitivity/recall of 56%, accuracy of 77.78%, and specificity of 89.36%. Further investigation into the misclassified cases indicated that ambiguity of abbreviation and misunderstanding of context are significant contributors to errors. The system found evidence of no matching for all false positive cases. To the best of our knowledge, no system in the public domain currently deploys an explainable AI-based approach to identify optimal patients for phase 1 oncology trials. This initial attempt to develop an AI system for patients and clinical trial matching in the context of phase 1 oncology trials showed promising results that are set to increase efficiency without sacrificing quality in patient-trial matching",PubMed
Empowering personalized pharmacogenomics with generative AI solutions,"This study evaluates an AI assistant developed using OpenAI's GPT-4 for interpreting pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing results, aiming to improve decision-making and knowledge sharing in clinical genetics and to enhance patient care with equitable access. The AI assistant employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which combines retrieval and generative techniques, by harnessing a knowledge base (KB) that comprises data from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC). It uses context-aware GPT-4 to generate tailored responses to user queries from this KB, further refined through prompt engineering and guardrails. Evaluated against a specialized PGx question catalog, the AI assistant showed high efficacy in addressing user queries. Compared with OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5, it demonstrated better performance, especially in provider-specific queries requiring specialized data and citations. Key areas for improvement include enhancing accuracy, relevancy, and representative language in responses. The integration of context-aware GPT-4 with RAG significantly enhanced the AI assistant's utility. RAG's ability to incorporate domain-specific CPIC data, including recent literature, proved beneficial. Challenges persist, such as the need for specialized genetic/PGx models to improve accuracy and relevancy and addressing ethical, regulatory, and safety concerns. This study underscores generative AI's potential for transforming healthcare provider support and patient accessibility to complex pharmacogenomic information. While careful implementation of large language models like GPT-4 is necessary, it is clear that they can substantially improve understanding of pharmacogenomic data. With further development, these tools could augment healthcare expertise, provider productivity, and the delivery of equitable, patient-centered healthcare services",PubMed
Evolution of publicly available large language models for complex decision-making in breast cancer care,"This study investigated the concordance of five different publicly available Large Language Models (LLM) with the recommendations of a multidisciplinary tumor board regarding treatment recommendations for complex breast cancer patient profiles. Five LLM, including three versions of ChatGPT (version 4 and 3.5, with data access until September 3021 and January 2022), Llama2, and Bard were prompted to produce treatment recommendations for 20 complex breast cancer patient profiles. LLM recommendations were compared to the recommendations of a multidisciplinary tumor board (gold standard), including surgical, endocrine and systemic treatment, radiotherapy, and genetic testing therapy options. GPT4 demonstrated the highest concordance (70.6%) for invasive breast cancer patient profiles, followed by GPT3.5 September 2021 (58.8%), GPT3.5 January 2022 (41.2%), Llama2 (35.3%) and Bard (23.5%). Including precancerous lesions of ductal carcinoma in situ, the identical ranking was reached with lower overall concordance for each LLM (GPT4 60.0%, GPT3.5 September 2021 50.0%, GPT3.5 January 2022 35.0%, Llama2 30.0%, Bard 20.0%). GPT4 achieved full concordance (100%) for radiotherapy. Lowest alignment was reached in recommending genetic testing, demonstrating a varying concordance (55.0% for GPT3.5 January 2022, Llama2 and Bard up to 85.0% for GPT4). This early feasibility study is the first to compare different LLM in breast cancer care with regard to changes in accuracy over time, i.e., with access to more data or through technological upgrades. Methodological advancement, i.e., the optimization of prompting techniques, and technological development, i.e., enabling data input control and secure data processing, are necessary in the preparation of large-scale and multicenter studies to provide evidence on their safe and reliable clinical application. At present, safe and evidenced use of LLM in clinical breast cancer care is not yet feasible",PubMed
Genetic influences on epilepsy outcomes: A whole-exome sequencing and health care records data linkage study,"This study was undertaken to develop a novel pathway linking genetic data with routinely collected data for people with epilepsy, and to analyze the influence of rare, deleterious genetic variants on epilepsy outcomes. We linked whole-exome sequencing (WES) data with routinely collected primary and secondary care data and natural language processing (NLP)-derived seizure frequency information for people with epilepsy within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank. The study participants were adults who had consented to participate in the Swansea Neurology Biobank, Wales, between 2016 and 2018. DNA sequencing was carried out as part of the Epi25 collaboration. For each individual, we calculated the total number and cumulative burden of rare and predicted deleterious genetic variants and the total of rare and deleterious variants in epilepsy and drug metabolism genes. We compared these measures with the following outcomes: (1) no unscheduled hospital admissions versus unscheduled admissions for epilepsy, (2) antiseizure medication (ASM) monotherapy versus polytherapy, and (3) at least 1 year of seizure freedom versus <1 year of seizure freedom. We linked genetic data for 107 individuals with epilepsy (52% female) to electronic health records. Twenty-six percent had unscheduled hospital admissions, and 70% were prescribed ASM polytherapy. Seizure frequency information was linked for 100 individuals, and 10 were seizure-free. There was no significant difference between the outcome groups in terms of the exome-wide and gene-based burden of rare and deleterious genetic variants. We successfully uploaded, annotated, and linked genetic sequence data and NLP-derived seizure frequency data to anonymized health care records in this proof-of-concept study. We did not detect a genetic influence on real-world epilepsy outcomes, but our study was limited by a small sample size. Future studies will require larger (WES) data to establish genetic variant contribution to epilepsy outcomes",PubMed
GPAD: a natural language processing-based application to extract the gene-disease association discovery information from OMIM,"Thousands of genes have been associated with different Mendelian conditions. One of the valuable sources to track these gene-disease associations (GDAs) is the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. However, most of the information in OMIM is textual, and heterogeneous (e.g. summarized by different experts), which complicates automated reading and understanding of the data. Here, we used Natural Language Processing (NLP) to make a tool (Gene-Phenotype Association Discovery (GPAD)) that could syntactically process OMIM text and extract the data of interest. GPAD applies a series of language-based techniques to the text obtained from OMIM API to extract GDA discovery-related information. GPAD can inform when a particular gene was associated with a specific phenotype, as well as the type of validation-whether through model organisms or cohort-based patient-matching approaches-for such an association. GPAD extracted data was validated with published reports and was compared with large language model. Utilizing GPAD's extracted data, we analysed trends in GDA discoveries, noting a significant increase in their rate after the introduction of exome sequencing, rising from an average of about 150-250 discoveries each year. Contrary to hopes of resolving most GDAs for Mendelian disorders by now, our data indicate a substantial decline in discovery rates over the past five years (2017-2022). This decline appears to be linked to the increasing necessity for larger cohorts to substantiate GDAs. The rising use of zebrafish and Drosophila as model organisms in providing evidential support for GDAs is also observed. GPAD's real-time analyzing capacity offers an up-to-date view of GDA discovery and could help in planning and managing the research strategies. In future, this solution can be extended or modified to capture other information in OMIM and scientific literature",PubMed
Multimodal Biomedical Data Fusion Using Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis and Cooperative Learning: A Cohort Study on COVID-19,"Through technological innovations, patient cohorts can be examined from multiple views with high-dimensional, multiscale biomedical data to classify clinical phenotypes and predict outcomes. Here, we aim to present our approach for analyzing multimodal data using unsupervised and supervised sparse linear methods in a COVID-19 patient cohort. This prospective cohort study of 149 adult patients was conducted in a tertiary care academic center. First, we used sparse canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to identify and quantify relationships across different data modalities, including viral genome sequencing, imaging, clinical data, and laboratory results. Then, we used cooperative learning to predict the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. We show that serum biomarkers representing severe disease and acute phase response correlate with original and wavelet radiomics features in the LLL frequency channel (corr(Xu1, Zv1) = 0.596, p-value < 0.001). Among radiomics features, histogram-based first-order features reporting the skewness, kurtosis, and uniformity have the lowest negative, whereas entropy-related features have the highest positive coefficients. Moreover, unsupervised analysis of clinical data and laboratory results gives insights into distinct clinical phenotypes. Leveraging the availability of global viral genome databases, we demonstrate that the Word2Vec natural language processing model can be used for viral genome encoding. It not only separates major SARS-CoV-2 variants but also allows the preservation of phylogenetic relationships among them. Our quadruple model using Word2Vec encoding achieves better prediction results in the supervised task. The model yields area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy values of 0.87 and 0.77, respectively.

Here, we aim to present our approach for analyzing multimodal data using unsupervised and supervised sparse linear methods in a COVID-19 patient cohort. This prospective cohort study of 149 adult patients was conducted in a tertiary care academic center. First, we used sparse canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to identify and quantify relationships across different data modalities, including viral genome sequencing, imaging, clinical data, and laboratory results. Then, we used cooperative learning to predict the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients: Intensive care unit admission. We show that serum biomarkers representing severe disease and acute phase response correlate with original and wavelet radiomics features in the LLL frequency channel (cor(Xu<sub>1</sub>, Zv<sub>1</sub>) = 0.596, p value < 0.001). Among radiomics features, histogram-based first-order features reporting the skewness, kurtosis, and uniformity have the lowest negative, whereas entropy-related features have the highest positive coefficients. Moreover, unsupervised analysis of clinical data and laboratory results gives insights into distinct clinical phenotypes. Leveraging the availability of global viral genome databases, we demonstrate that the Word2Vec natural language processing model can be used for viral genome encoding. It not only separates major SARS-CoV-2 variants but also allows the preservation of phylogenetic relationships among them. Our quadruple model using Word2Vec encoding achieves better prediction results in the supervised task. The model yields area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy values of 0.87 and 0.77, respectively. Our study illustrates that sparse CCA analysis and cooperative learning are powerful techniques for handling high-dimensional, multimodal data to investigate multivariate associations in unsupervised and supervised tasks",PubMed
Facilitating family communication of familial hypercholesterolemia genetic risk: Assessing engagement with innovative chatbot technology from the IMPACT-FH study,"To assess use of two web-based conversational agents, the Family Sharing Chatbot (FSC) and One Month Chatbot (OMC), by individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). FSC and OMC were sent using an opt-out methodology to a cohort of individuals receiving a FH genetic result. Data from 7/1/2021 through 5/12/2022 was obtained from the electronic health record and the chatbots' HIPAA-secure web portal. Of 175 subjects, 21 (12%) opted out of the chatbots. Older individuals were more likely to opt out. Most (91/154, 59%) preferred receiving chatbots via the patient EHR portal. Seventy-five individuals (49%) clicked the FSC link, 62 (40%) interacted, and 36 (23%) shared a chatbot about their FH result with at least one relative. Ninety-two of the subjects received OMC, 22 (23%) clicked the link and 20 (21%) interacted. Individuals who shared were majority female and younger on average than the overall cohort. Reminders tended to increase engagement. Results demonstrate characteristics relevant to chatbot engagement. Individuals may be more inclined to receive chatbots if integrated within the patient EHR portal. Frequent reminders can potentially improve chatbot utilization. FSC and OMC employ innovative digital health technology that can facilitate family communication about hereditary conditions",PubMed
Association of reviewer experience with discriminating human-written versus ChatGPT-written abstracts,"To determine if reviewer experience impacts the ability to discriminate between human-written and ChatGPT-written abstracts. Thirty reviewers (10 seniors, 10 juniors, and 10 residents) were asked to differentiate between 10 ChatGPT-written and 10 human-written (fabricated) abstracts. For the study, 10 gynecologic oncology abstracts were fabricated by the authors. For each human-written abstract we generated a ChatGPT matching abstract by using the same title and the fabricated results of each of the human generated abstracts. A web-based questionnaire was used to gather demographic data and to record the reviewers' evaluation of the 20 abstracts. Comparative statistics and multivariable regression were used to identify factors associated with a higher correct identification rate. The 30 reviewers discriminated 20 abstracts, giving a total of 600 abstract evaluations. The reviewers were able to correctly identify 300/600 (50%) of the abstracts: 139/300 (46.3%) of the ChatGPT-generated abstracts and 161/300 (53.7%) of the human-written abstracts (p=0.07). Human-written abstracts had a higher rate of correct identification (median (IQR) 56.7% (49.2-64.1%) vs 45.0% (43.2-48.3%), p=0.023). Senior reviewers had a higher correct identification rate (60%) than junior reviewers and residents (45% each; p=0.043 and p=0.002, respectively). In a linear regression model including the experience level of the reviewers, familiarity with artificial intelligence (AI) and the country in which the majority of medical training was achieved (English speaking vs non-English speaking), the experience of the reviewer (β=10.2 (95% CI 1.8 to 18.7)) and familiarity with AI (β=7.78 (95% CI 0.6 to 15.0)) were independently associated with the correct identification rate (p=0.019 and p=0.035, respectively). In a correlation analysis the number of publications by the reviewer was positively correlated with the correct identification rate (r28)=0.61, p<0.001. A total of 46.3% of abstracts written by ChatGPT were detected by reviewers. The correct identification rate increased with reviewer and publication experience",PubMed
Enhancing phenotype recognition in clinical notes using large language models: PhenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT,"To enhance phenotype recognition in clinical notes of genetic diseases, we developed two models-PhenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT-for expanding the vocabularies of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. While HPO offers a standardized vocabulary for phenotypes, existing tools often fail to capture the full scope of phenotypes due to limitations from traditional heuristic or rule-based approaches. Our models leverage large language models to automate the detection of phenotype terms, including those not in the current HPO. We compare these models with PhenoTagger, another HPO recognition tool, and found that our models identify a wider range of phenotype concepts, including previously uncharacterized ones. Our models also show strong performance in case studies on biomedical literature. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of BERT- and GPT-based models in aspects such as architecture and accuracy. Overall, our models enhance automated phenotype detection from clinical texts, improving downstream analyses on human diseases",PubMed
A comparative evaluation of ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4 in responses to selected genetics questions,"To evaluate the efficacy of ChatGPT 4 (GPT-4) in delivering genetic information about BRCA1, HFE, and MLH1, building on previous findings with ChatGPT 3.5 (GPT-3.5). To focus on assessing the utility, limitations, and ethical implications of using ChatGPT in medical settings. A structured survey was developed to assess GPT-4's clinical value. An expert panel of genetic counselors and clinical geneticists evaluated GPT-4's responses to these questions. We also performed comparative analysis with GPT-3.5, utilizing descriptive statistics and using Prism 9 for data analysis. The findings indicate improved accuracy in GPT-4 over GPT-3.5 (P < .0001). However, notable errors in accuracy remained. The relevance of responses varied in GPT-4, but was generally favorable, with a mean in the ""somewhat agree"" range. There was no difference in performance by disease category. The 7-question subset of the Bot Usability Scale (BUS-15) showed no statistically significant difference between the groups but trended lower in the GPT-4 version. The study underscores GPT-4's potential role in genetic education, showing notable progress yet facing challenges like outdated information and the necessity of ongoing refinement. Our results, while showing promise, emphasizes the importance of balancing technological innovation with ethical responsibility in healthcare information delivery",PubMed
Expression of RAG and secondary gene rearrangement of BCR in mature peripheral B lymphocytes in Takayasu arteritis,"To evaluate the expression of recombinant activating gene (RAG) and B cell receptor (BCR) gene rearrangements in mature peripheral B lymphocytes in Takayasu arteritis (TA) to explore the possible mechanism of humoral immune response in TA. Ten patients with TA and 10 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (control group) from Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University and Peking Union Medical College Hospital, between 2022 and 2023, were included in this study. The mRNA of the RAG was measured using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR). Western blotting was used to detect RAG protein expression levels. NGS technology was used to detect BCR gene rearrangement. The mRNA expression level of RAG1 and RAG2 in peripheral mature B lymphocytes in patients with TA was significantly higher than in the control group (RAG1 5.56 ± 1.71 vs. 1.94 ± 0.86, p < 0.05; RAG2 5.26 ± 1.59 vs. 1.65 ± 0.64, p < 0.05), respectively. The protein expression level of the RAG1 and the RAG2 in peripheral mature B lymphocytes in patients with TA was significantly higher than in the healthy control group (RAG1 4.33 ± 1.58 vs. 1.52 ± 0.59, p < 0.001; RAG2 4.67 ± 1.88 vs. 1.59 ± 0.56, p < 0.001). The number of peripheral B lymphocyte BCR clonotypes in the group of patients with TA was significantly higher than in the normal control group (1574 ± 317.7 vs. 801.3 ± 202.1, p < 0.05). The abundance of IGHV clones in patients with TA was higher than in the normal control group (31.185% vs. 13.449%), which was positively correlated with the expression levels of RAG1 and RAG2 (correlation coefficient r = 1.00, p < 0.001), respectively. High expression of the RAG gene coexists with secondary BCR gene rearrangement in mature peripheral B lymphocytes in patients with TA, providing important clues regarding the potential humoral response in TA; however, further studies with larger samples are needed",PubMed
SAFPred: synteny-aware gene function prediction for bacteria using protein embeddings,"Today, we know the function of only a small fraction of the protein sequences predicted from genomic data. This problem is even more salient for bacteria, which represent some of the most phylogenetically and metabolically diverse taxa on Earth. This low rate of bacterial gene annotation is compounded by the fact that most function prediction algorithms have focused on eukaryotes, and conventional annotation approaches rely on the presence of similar sequences in existing databases. However, often there are no such sequences for novel bacterial proteins. Thus, we need improved gene function prediction methods tailored for bacteria. Recently, transformer-based language models-adopted from the natural language processing field-have been used to obtain new representations of proteins, to replace amino acid sequences.

Distinguishing word identity and sequence context in DNA language models,"Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are very suited for biological sequence data, because the structure of protein and nucleic acid sequences show many analogies to natural language. Complex relationships in biological sequence can be learned, although there may not be a clear concept of words, because they can be generated through tokenization. Training is subsequently performed for masked token prediction. With this strategy, the models learn both the token sequence identity and a larger sequence context. We developed a framework to interrogate what a model learns, which is both relevant for the interpretability of the model and to evaluate its potential for specific tasks.  We used a DNA language model, which is trained on the human reference genome with a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model. In this model, tokens are defined with overlapping k-mers. To gain insight into the models learning, we interrogated how the model performs predictions, extracted token embeddings, and defined a fine-tuning benchmarking task to predict the next tokens of different sizes without overlaps. This task is very suited to evaluate different pretrained DNA language models, also called foundation models, since it does not interrogate specific genome biology, does not depend on the tokenization strategy, the size of the vocabulary, the dictionary, or the number of parameters used to train the model. Lastly, the task performs without leakage of information from token identity into the prediction task, which makes it particularly useful to evaluate the learning of sequence context.  Through this assessment we discovered that the model with overlapping k-mers struggles to learn larger sequence context. Instead, the learned embeddings largely represent token sequence. Still, good performance is achieved for genome biology inspired fine-tuning tasks. Models with overlapping tokens may be used for tasks where a larger sequence context is of less relevance, but the token sequence directly represents the desired learning feature. This emphasizes the need to interrogate knowledge representation in biological large language models. Transparency is particularly important for biomedical use cases and an understanding of what the models are learning can be used to match the model to the desired task

"Long-term efficacy and safety of a treatment strategy for HIV infection using protease inhibitor monotherapy: 8-year routine clinical care follow-up from a randomised, controlled, open-label pragmatic trial (PIVOT)","Treatment-simplification strategies are important tools for patient-centred management. We evaluated long-term outcomes from a PI monotherapy switch strategy. Eligible participants attending 43 UK treatment centres had a viral load (VL) below 50 copies/ml for at least 24 weeks on combination ART. Participants were randomised to maintain ongoing triple therapy (OT) or switch to a strategy of physician-selected PI monotherapy (PI-mono) with prompt return to combination therapy if VL rebounded. The primary outcome, previously reported, was loss of future drug options after 3 years, defined as new intermediate/high level resistance to at least one drug to which the participant's virus was considered sensitive at trial entry. Here we report resistance and disease outcomes after further extended follow-up in routine care. The study was registered as ISRCTN04857074. We randomised 587 participants to OT (291) or PI-mono (296) between Nov 4, 2008, and July 28, 2010 and followed them for a median of more than 8 years (100 months) until 2018. At the end of this follow-up time, one or more future drug options had been lost in 7 participants in the OT group and 6 in the PI-mono group; estimated cumulative risk by 8 years of 2.7% and 2.1% respectively (difference -0.6%, 95% CI -3.2% to 2.0%). Only one PI-mono participant developed resistance to the protease inhibitor they were taking (atazanavir). Serious clinical events (death, serious AIDS, and serious non-AIDS) were infrequent; reported in a total of 12 (4.1%) participants in the OT group and 23 (7.8%) in the PI-mono group (P = 0.08) over the entire follow-up period. A strategy of PI monotherapy, with regular VL monitoring and prompt reintroduction of combination treatment following rebound, preserved future treatment options. Findings confirm the high genetic barrier to resistance of the PI drug class that makes them well suited for creative, patient-centred, treatment-simplification approaches. The possibility of a small excess risk of serious clinical events with the PI monotherapy strategy cannot be excluded.

A rare case of uncharacterized autoinflammatory disease: Patient carrying variations in NLRP3 and TNFRSF1A genes,"Tumor necrosis factor type 1A receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) and cryopyrin-associated autoinflammatory syndrome (CAPS) are rare monogenic autoinflammatory diseases (AIDs) mainly caused by pathogenic variations in the TNFRSF1A and NLRP3 genes, respectively. Here, we describe a unique patient presenting with symptoms overlapping both TRAPS and CAPS, without known pathogenic variants in the respective genes. The patient harbored the p.Val200Met variation in NLRP3 and the p.Ser226Cys variation in TNFRSF1A, prompting us to delve deeper into the functional analysis due to conflicting or inconclusive pathogenicity interpretations of the variants across various databases. Molecular dynamics analysis of the p.Val200Met variation in NLRP3 revealed a rigid conformation in the helical domain 2 subdomain of the NACHT domain. This increased rigidity suggests a potential mechanism by which this variation supports the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Notably, the patient's peripheral mononuclear blood cells demonstrated an elevated IL-1β response upon lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induction. Subsequent initiation of anti-IL-1β therapy resulted in a significant alleviation of the patient's symptoms, further supporting our hypothesis. We interpret these findings as suggestive of a potential pathophysiological role for the NLPR3 p.Val200Met variation in shaping the patient's clinical phenotype, which was also supported by clinical and genetic analysis of the family. This case underscores the complexity of the genetic landscape in AIDs and highlights the value of combining family genetic and functional data to refine the understanding and management of such challenging cases",PubMed
Lipid-Laden Macrophages Recycle Myelin to Feed Glioblastoma,"Tumor-associated microglia and macrophages (TAM) make up the largest immune cell population in the glioblastoma (GBM) tumor microenvironment. Given the heterogeneity and plasticity of TAMs in the GBM tumor microenvironment, understanding the context-dependent cancer cell-TAM symbiotic interaction is crucial for understanding GBM biology and developing effective therapies. In a recent issue of Cell, Kloosterman and colleagues identified a subpopulation of glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein Bhigh lipid-laden microglia and macrophages (LLM) in GBM. Mesenchymal-like GBM cells help generate the LLM phenotype. Reciprocally, LLMs are epigenetically rewired to recycle myelin and transfer the lipid from myelin to cancer cells, fueling mesenchymal-like GBM progression in a liver X receptor/ABCA1-dependent manner. Together, leveraging LLMs opens new therapeutic possibilities for rewiring the metabolism-mediated tumor-TAM interaction during GBM progression",PubMed
Clinical implications of tumor-based next-generation sequencing in high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer,"Tumor-based next-generation sequencing is used inconsistently as a tool to tailor treatment of ovarian cancer, yet beyond detection of somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, the clinical benefit is not well established. This study aimed to assess the clinical relevance of tumor-based next-generation sequencing (tbNGS) in patients with ovarian cancer. This retrospective study included patients with high-grade epithelial ovarian carcinoma. tbNGS results were identified in the electronic medical record using optical character recognition and natural language processing. Genetic, clinical, and demographic information was collected. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were calculated and compared using log-rank tests. Multivariate Cox regression and clustering analyses were used to identify patterns of genetic alterations associated with survival. Of 1092 patients in the described population, 409 (37.5%) had tbNGS results. Nearly all (96.1% [393/409]) had one or more genetic alterations. In 25.9% (106/409) of patients, an alteration that aligned with a targeted treatment was identified, and in an additional 48.7% (199/409), tbNGS results suggested eligibility for an investigational agent or clinical trial. The most frequent alterations were TP53, PIK3CA, and NF1 mutations, and CCNE1 amplification. Together, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were associated with longer PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-0.92; p = .02), whereas AKT2 amplification was associated with shorter PFS (HR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.002-14.88; p < .05). Multivariate Cox regression and clustering analyses identified several combinations of genetic alterations that corresponded to outcomes in patients with high-grade serous carcinoma. tbNGS often yields clinically relevant information. Detailed analysis of population-level tumor genomics may help to identify therapeutic targets and guide development of clinical decision support tools. Although more and more patients with ovarian cancer are undergoing tumor-based next-generation sequencing to identify genetic mutations in their tumors, the benefits of such testing are not well established. In a group of over 400 patients with ovarian cancer who underwent tumor-based next-generation sequencing in the course of their treatment, nearly all patients had one or more genetic alterations detected, and one out of four patients had a mutation that qualified them for a personalized treatment option",PubMed
Tumor-Induced Osteomalacia due to Sarcomatoid Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma Confounded by Drug-Induced Fanconi Syndrome,"Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is an exceedingly rare paraneoplastic condition characterized by hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia, fragility fractures, and fatigue. A 39-year-old man was assessed for hemoptysis, pathological rib fractures, and fatigue, and was found to have a chest mass with lung metastasis. Biopsy of the mass suggested high-grade epithelioid and spindle cell neoplasm. He was initially treated for soft tissue sarcoma with an ifosfamide-based regimen and developed Fanconi syndrome that resolved on cessation of ifosfamide. Serum phosphate remained low. A low tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate to glomerular filtration rate ratio (TmP/GFR) indicated disproportionate phosphaturia, while a severely elevated fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) level enabled a diagnosis of TIO. He was started on phosphate and calcitriol supplementation. Subsequent next-generation sequencing demonstrated a RET-fusion mutation, leading to reclassification of his malignancy to a sarcomatoid non-small cell lung carcinoma. He was switched to selpercatinib, a targeted RET-kinase inhibitor approved for locally advanced or metastatic RET-fusion-positive solid tumors. This induced tumor remission with subsequent normalization of his FGF23 levels and hypophosphatemia. Despite the presence of a confounding etiology like drug-induced Fanconi syndrome, persistence of hypophosphatemia should prompt a workup of TIO, especially in the presence of a tumor",PubMed
Macrophage-mediated myelin recycling fuels brain cancer malignancy,"Tumors growing in metabolically challenged environments, such as glioblastoma in the brain, are particularly reliant on crosstalk with their tumor microenvironment (TME) to satisfy their high energetic needs. To study the intricacies of this metabolic interplay, we interrogated the heterogeneity of the glioblastoma TME using single-cell and multi-omics analyses and identified metabolically rewired tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) subpopulations with pro-tumorigenic properties. These TAM subsets, termed lipid-laden macrophages (LLMs) to reflect their cholesterol accumulation, are epigenetically rewired, display immunosuppressive features, and are enriched in the aggressive mesenchymal glioblastoma subtype. Engulfment of cholesterol-rich myelin debris endows subsets of TAMs to acquire an LLM phenotype. Subsequently, LLMs directly transfer myelin-derived lipids to cancer cells in an LXR/Abca1-dependent manner, thereby fueling the heightened metabolic demands of mesenchymal glioblastoma. Our work provides an in-depth understanding of the immune-metabolic interplay during glioblastoma progression, thereby laying a framework to unveil targetable metabolic vulnerabilities in glioblastoma",PubMed
Development and Validation of a Computable Phenotype for Turner Syndrome Utilizing Electronic Health Records from a National Pediatric Network,"Turner syndrome (TS) is a genetic condition occurring in [~]1 in 2,000 females characterized by the complete or partial absence of the second sex chromosome. TS research faces similar challenges to many other pediatric rare disease conditions, with homogenous, single-center, underpowered studies. Secondary data analyses utilizing Electronic Health Record (EHR) have the potential to address these limitations, however, an algorithm to accurately identify TS cases in EHR data is needed. We developed a computable phenotype to identify patients with TS using PEDSnet, a pediatric research network. This computable phenotype was validated through chart review; true positives and negatives and false positives and negatives were used to assess accuracy at both primary and external validation sites. The optimal algorithm consisted of the following criteria: female sex, [&ge;]1 outpatient encounter, and [&ge;]3 encounters with a diagnosis code that maps to TS, yielding average sensitivity 0.97, specificity 0.88, and C-statistic 0.93 across all sites. The accuracy of any estradiol prescriptions yielded an average C-statistic of 0.91 across sites and 0.80 for transdermal and oral formulations separately. PEDSnet and computable phenotyping are powerful tools in providing large, diverse samples to pragmatically study rare pediatric conditions like TS",medrxiv
Stress during puberty and adulthood pregnancy impact histone acetylation regulators in the hypothalamus,"Undergoing stressful events during puberty puts women at risk for a variety of negative outcomes, and this risk is heightened if they become pregnant later in life. We previously demonstrated that stress during puberty combined with pregnancy in adulthood led to a blunted response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis in humans and mice. We have begun to understand the mechanisms underlying this effect by examining the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), a key regulator of the HPA axis. Prior studies uncovered an increase in chromatin openness within the PVN of the at-risk mice, with bioinformatic analyses implicating histone acetylation in this increased openness. Here, we measured the activity of histone acetyltransferase (HATs) and histone deacetylase (HDACs), the writers and erasers of histone acetylation, within the PVN to further characterize how stress during puberty and pregnancy may be interacting to produce a blunted stress response. We found that histone acetylation tone within the PVN is predictive of prior transcriptional and chromatin results, with pregnant, pubertally stressed females having a pro-acetylation tone within the PVN. These findings establish a role for regulators of acetylation in the open chromatin landscape characteristic in the PVN of pregnant, pubertally stressed females. Overall, this study provides insight into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying female-relevant risk for stress dysregulation, a central endophenotype of affective disorders",biorxiv
A hybrid machine learning model for predicting gene expression from epigenetics across fungal species,"Understanding and controlling gene expression in organisms is essential for optimizing biological processes, whether in service of bioeconomic processes, human health, or environmental regulation. Epigenetic modifications play a significant role in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure, DNA accessibility and protein binding. While a significant amount is known about the combinatorial effects of epigenetics on gene expression, our understanding of the degree to which the orchestration of these mechanisms is conserved in gene expression regulation across species, particularly for non-model organisms, remains limited. In this study, we aim to predict gene expression levels based on epigenetic modifications in chromatin across different fungal species, to enable transferring information about well characterized species to poorly understood species. We developed a custom hybrid deep learning model, EAGLE (Evolutionary distance-Adaptable Gene expression Learned from Epigenomics), which combines convolutional layers and multi-head attention mechanisms to capture both local and global dependencies in epigenetic data. We demonstrate the cross-species performance of EAGLE across fungi, a kingdom containing both pathogens and biomanufacturing chassis and where understanding epigenetic regulation in under-characterized species would be transformative for bioeconomic, environmental, and biomedical applications. EAGLE outperformed shallow learning models and a modified transformer benchmarking model, achieving up to 80% accuracy and 89% AUROC for intra-species validation and 77% accuracy and 83% AUROC in cross-species prediction tasks. SHAP analysis revealed that EAGLE identifies important epigenetic features that drive gene expression, providing insights for experimental design and potential future epigenome engineering work. Our findings demonstrate the potential of EAGLE to generalize across fungal species, offering a versatile tool for optimizing fungal gene expression in multiple sectors. In addition, our architecture can be adapted for cross-species tasks across the tree of life where detailed molecular and genetic information can be scarce",biorxiv
Modeling and predicting single-cell multi-gene perturbation responses with scLAMBDA,"Understanding cellular responses to genetic perturbations is essential for understanding gene regulation and phenotype formation. While high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing has facilitated detailed profiling of heterogeneous transcriptional responses to perturbations at the single-cell level, there remains a pressing need for computational models that can decode the mechanisms driving these responses and accurately predict outcomes to prioritize target genes for experimental design. Here, we present scLAMBDA, a deep generative learning framework designed to model and predict single-cell transcriptional responses to genetic perturbations, including single-gene and combinatorial multi-gene perturbations. By leveraging gene embeddings derived from large language models, scLAMBDA effectively integrates prior biological knowledge and disentangles basal cell states from perturbation-specific salient representations. Through comprehensive evaluations on multiple single-cell CRISPR Perturb-seq datasets, scLAMBDA consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods in predicting perturbation outcomes, achieving higher prediction accuracy. Notably, scLAMBDA demonstrated robust generalization to unseen target genes and perturbations, and its predictions captured both average expression changes and the heterogeneity of single-cell responses. Furthermore, its predictions enable diverse downstream analyses, including the identification of differentially expressed genes and the exploration of genetic interactions, demonstrating its utility and versatility",biorxiv

The datasets are mapped to matched, diploid genomes with long-read phasing and structural variants, instantiating a catalog of >1 million allele-specific loci. These loci exhibit coordinated activity along haplotypes and are less conserved than corresponding, non-allele-specific ones. Surprisingly, a deep-learning transformer model can predict the allele-specific activity based only on local nucleotide-sequence context, highlighting the importance of transcription-factor-binding motifs particularly sensitive to variants. Furthermore, combining EN-TEx with existing genome annotations reveals strong associations between allele-specific and GWAS loci. It also enables models for transferring known eQTLs to difficult-to-profile tissues (e.g., from skin to heart). Overall, EN-TEx provides rich data and generalizable models for more accurate personal functional genomics",PubMed
Healthcare utilization and clinical characteristics of genetic epilepsy in electronic health records,"Understanding the clinical characteristics and medical treatment of individuals affected by genetic epilepsies is instrumental in guiding selection for genetic testing, defining the phenotype range of these rare disorders, optimizing patient care pathways and pinpointing unaddressed medical need by quantifying healthcare resource utilization. To date, a matched longitudinal cohort study encompassing the entire spectrum of clinical characteristics and medical treatment from childhood through adolescence has not been performed. We identified individuals with genetic and non-genetic epilepsies and onset at ages 0-5 years by linkage across the Cleveland Clinic Health System. We used natural language processing to extract medical terms and procedures from longitudinal electronic health records and tested for cross-sectional and temporal associations with genetic epilepsy. We implemented a two-stage design: in the discovery cohort, individuals were stratified as being 'likely genetic' or 'non-genetic' by a natural language processing algorithm, and controls did not receive genetic testing. The validation cohort consisted of cases with genetic epilepsy confirmed by manual chart review and an independent set of controls who received negative genetic testing. The discovery and validation cohorts consisted of 503 and 344 individuals with genetic epilepsy and matched controls, respectively. The median age at the first encounter was 0.1 years and 7.9 years at the last encounter, and the mean duration of follow-up was 8.2 years. We extracted 188,295 Unified Medical Language System annotations for statistical analysis across 9659 encounters. Individuals with genetic epilepsy received an earlier epilepsy diagnosis and had more frequent and complex encounters with the healthcare system. Notably, the highest enrichment of encounters compared with the non-genetic groups was found during the transition from paediatric to adult care. Our computational approach could validate established comorbidities of genetic epilepsies, such as behavioural abnormality and intellectual disability. We also revealed novel associations for genitourinary abnormalities (odds ratio 1.91, 95% confidence interval: 1.66-2.20, P = 6.16 × 10<sup>-19</sup>) linked to a spectrum of underrecognized epilepsy-associated genetic disorders. This case-control study leveraged real-world data to identify novel features associated with the likelihood of a genetic aetiology and quantified the healthcare utilization of genetic epilepsies compared with matched controls. Our results strongly recommend early genetic testing to stratify individuals into specialized care paths, thus improving the clinical management of people with genetic epilepsies",PubMed
PGSbuilder: An end-to-end platform for human genome association analysis and polygenic risk score predictions,"Understanding the genetic basis of human complex diseases is increasingly important in the development of precision medicine. Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become a key technique for detecting associations between common diseases and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present in a cohort of individuals. Alternatively, the polygenic risk score (PRS), which often applies results from GWAS summary statistics, is calculated for the estimation of genetic propensity to a trait at the individual level. Despite many GWAS and PRS tools being available to analyze a large volume of genotype data, most clinicians and medical researchers are often not familiar with the bioinformatics tools and lack access to a high-performance computing cluster resource. To fill this gap, we provide a publicly available web server, PGSbuilder, for the GWAS and PRS analysis of human genomes with variant annotations. The user-friendly and intuitive PGSbuilder web server is developed to facilitate the discovery of the genetic variants associated with complex traits and diseases for medical professionals with limited computational skills. For GWAS analysis, PGSbuilder provides the most renowned analysis tool PLINK 2.0 package. For PRS, PGSbuilder provides six different PRS methods including Clumping and Thresholding, Lassosum, LDPred2, GenEpi, PRS-CS, and PRSice2. Furthermore, PGSbuilder provides an intuitive user interface to examine the annotated functional effects of variants from known biomedical databases and relevant literature using advanced natural language processing approaches. In conclusion, PGSbuilder offers a reliable platform to aid researchers in advancing the public perception of genomic risk and precision medicine for human disease genetics.

A Personalised 3D+t Mesh Generative Model for Unveiling Normal Heart Dynamics,"Understanding the structure and motion of the heart is crucial for diagnosing and managing cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of global death. There is wide variation in cardiac shape and motion patterns, that are influenced by demographic, anthropometric and disease factors. Unravelling the normal patterns of shape and motion, as well as understanding how each individual deviates from the norm, would facilitate accurate diagnosis and personalised treatment strategies. To this end, we developed a novel conditional generative model, MeshHeart, to learn the distribution of cardiac shape and motion patterns. MeshHeart is capable of generating 3D+t cardiac mesh sequences, taking into account clinical factors such as age, sex, weight and height. To model the high-dimensional and complex spatio-temporal mesh data, MeshHeart employs a geometric encoder to represent cardiac meshes in a latent space, followed by a temporal Transformer to model the motion dynamics of latent representations. Based on MeshHeart, we investigate the latent space of 3D+t cardiac mesh sequences and propose a novel distance metric termed latent delta, which quantifies the deviation of a real heart from its personalised normative pattern in the latent space. In experiments using a large dataset of 38,309 subjects, MeshHeart demonstrates a high performance in cardiac mesh sequence reconstruction and generation. Features defined in the latent space are highly discriminative for cardiac disease classification, whereas the latent delta exhibits strong correlation with clinical phenotypes in phenome-wide association studies. The codes and models of this study will be released to benefit further research on digital heart modelling",arXiv
Assessing Large Language Model Performance Related to Aging in Genetic Conditions,"Unlike some health conditions that have been extensively delineated throughout the lifespan, many genetic conditions are largely described in pediatric populations, with a focus on early manifestations like congenital anomalies and developmental delay. An apparent gap exists in understanding clinical features and optimal management as patients age. Generative artificial intelligence is transforming biomedical disciplines including through the introduction of large language models (LLMs). Motivated by these advances, we explored how LLMs handle age with respect to 282 genetic conditions selected based on prevalence. We divided these conditions into five categories: Disorders limited to childhood; Disorders limited to adulthood; Disorders with changes in presentation across ages; Disorders with changes in management across ages; Disorders with no changes across ages. We evaluated Llama-2-70b-chat (70b) and GPT-3.5 (GPT) capabilities at generating accurate medical vignettes for these conditions based on Correctness, Completeness, and Conciseness as graded by 3 clinicians. Using accurately generated vignettes as in-context prompts, we further generated and evaluated patient-geneticist dialogues and assessed LLM performance in answering specific questions regarding age-based management plans for a subset of conditions. Results revealed impressive performances of 70b with in-context prompting and GPT in generating vignettes. We overall did not observe age-based biases, though our experiments identified statistically significant differences in some areas related to LLM output. Despite impressive capabilities, LLMs still have limitations in clinical applications",medrxiv
Prediction of molecular subclasses of uveal melanoma by deep learning using routine haematoxylin-eosin-stained tissue slides,"Uveal melanoma has a high propensity to metastasize. Prognosis is associated with specific driver mutations and copy number variations, and these can only be obtained after genetic testing. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of patient outcome prediction using deep learning on haematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained primary uveal melanoma slides in comparison to molecular testing. In this retrospective study of patients with uveal melanoma, 113 patients from the Erasmus Medical Centre who underwent enucleation had tumour tissue analysed for molecular classification between 1993 and 2020. Routine HE-stained slides were scanned to obtain whole-slide images (WSI). After annotation of regions of interest, tiles of 1024 × 1024 pixels were extracted at a magnification of 40×. An ablation study to select the best-performing deep-learning model was carried out using three state-of-the-art deep-learning models (EfficientNet, Vision Transformer, and Swin Transformer). Deep-learning models were subjected to a training cohort (n = 40), followed by a validation cohort (n = 20), and finally underwent a test cohort (n = 48). A k-fold cross-validation (k = 3) of validation and test cohorts (n = 113 of three classes: BAP1, SF3B1, EIF1AX) demonstrated Swin Transformer as the best-performing deep-learning model to predict molecular subclasses based on HE stains. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.83 ± 0.09 on the validation cohort and 0.75 ± 0.04 on the test cohort. Within the subclasses, this model correctly predicted 70% BAP1-mutated, 61% SF3B1-mutated and 80% EIF1AX-mutated UM in the test set. This study showcases the potential of the deep-learning methodology for predicting molecular subclasses in a multiclass manner using HE-stained WSI. This development holds promise for advanced prognostication of UM patients without the need of molecular or immunohistochemical testing. Additionally, this study suggests there are distinct histopathological features per subclass; mainly utilizing epithelioid cellular morphology for BAP1-classification, but an unknown feature distinguishes EIF1AX and SF3B1",PubMed
Sars-escape network for escape prediction of SARS-COV-2,"Viruses have coevolved with their hosts for over millions of years and learned to escape the host's immune system. Although not all genetic changes in viruses are deleterious, some significant mutations lead to the escape of neutralizing antibodies and weaken the immune system, which increases infectivity and transmissibility, thereby impeding the development of antiviral drugs or vaccines. Accurate and reliable identification of viral escape mutational sequences could be a good indicator for therapeutic design. We developed a computational model that recognizes significant mutational sequences based on escape feature identification using natural language processing along with prior knowledge of experimentally validated escape mutants. Our machine learning-based computational approach can recognize the significant spike protein sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 using sequence data alone. This modelling approach can be applied to other viruses, such as influenza, monkeypox and HIV using knowledge of escape mutants and relevant protein sequence datasets. Complete source code and pre-trained models for escape prediction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 protein sequences are available on Github at https://github.com/PremSinghBist/Sars-CoV-2-Escape-Model.git. The dataset is deposited to Zenodo at: doi: 10.5281/zenodo.7142638. The Python scripts are easy to run and customize as needed. premsing212@jbnu.ac.kr",PubMed

Enhancing Phenotype Recognition in Clinical Notes Using Large Language Models: PhenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT,"We hypothesize that large language models (LLMs) based on the transformer architecture can enable automated detection of clinical phenotype terms, including terms not documented in the HPO. In this study, we developed two types of models: PhenoBCBERT, a BERT-based model, utilizing Bio+Clinical BERT as its pre-trained model, and PhenoGPT, a GPT-based model that can be initialized from diverse GPT models, including open-source versions such as GPT-J, Falcon, and LLaMA, as well as closed-source versions such as GPT-3 and GPT-3.5. We compared our methods with PhenoTagger, a recently developed HPO recognition tool that combines rule-based and deep learning methods. We found that our methods can extract more phenotype concepts, including novel ones not characterized by HPO. We also performed case studies on biomedical literature to illustrate how new phenotype information can be recognized and extracted. We compared current BERT-based versus GPT-based models for phenotype tagging, in multiple aspects including model architecture, memory usage, speed, accuracy, and privacy protection. We also discussed the addition of a negation step and an HPO normalization layer to the transformer models for improved HPO term tagging. In conclusion, PhenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT enable the automated discovery of phenotype terms from clinical notes and biomedical literature, facilitating automated downstream tasks to derive new biological insights on human diseases
==========
To enhance phenotype recognition in clinical notes of genetic diseases, we developed two models - PhenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT - for expanding the vocabularies of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. While HPO offers a standardized vocabulary for phenotypes, existing tools often fail to capture the full scope of phenotypes, due to limitations from traditional heuristic or rule-based approaches. Our models leverage large language models (LLMs) to automate the detection of phenotype terms, including those not in the current HPO. We compared these models to PhenoTagger, another HPO recognition tool, and found that our models identify a wider range of phenotype concepts, including previously uncharacterized ones. Our models also showed strong performance in case studies on biomedical literature. We evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of BERT-based and GPT-based models in aspects such as architecture and accuracy. Overall, our models enhance automated phenotype detection from clinical texts, improving downstream analyses on human diseases","PubMed,arXiv"
STAT1 overexpression triggers aplastic anemia: a pilot study unravelling novel pathogenetic insights in bone marrow failure,"We identified STAT1 gain of function (GOF) in a 32-year-old female with pallor, weakness, cough, and dyspnea admitted to our Division of Medicine. She had severe oral ulcers (OU), type 1 diabetes (T1DM), and pancytopenia. Bone marrow (BM) biopsy showed the absence of erythroid precursors. Peripheral blood parameters such as neutrophils < 500/mL, reticulocytes < 2%, and BM hypo-cellularity allowed to diagnose severe aplastic anemia. A heterozygous variant (p.520T>C, p.Cys174Arg) of STAT1 was uncovered. Thus, p.Cys174Arg mutation was investigated as potentially responsible for the patient's inborn immunity error and aplastic anemia. Although STAT1 GOF is rare, aplastic anemia is a more common condition; therefore, we explored STAT1 functional role in the pathobiology of BM failure. Interestingly, in a cohort of six patients with idiopathic aplastic anemia, enhanced phospho-STAT1 levels were observed on BM immunostaining. Next, the most remarkable features associated with STAT1 signaling dysregulation were examined: in both pure red cell aplasia and aplastic anemia, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell genetic variants and mutations display enhanced signaling activities related to the JAK-STAT pathway. Inborn errors of immunity may represent a paradigmatic condition to unravel crucial pathobiological mechanisms shared by common pathological conditions. Findings from our case-based approach and the phenotype correspondence to idiopathic aplastic anemia cases prompt further statistically powered prospective studies aiming to elucidate the exact role and theragnostic window for JAK/STAT targeting in this clinical context. Nonetheless, we demonstrate how a comprehensive study of patients with primary immunodeficiencies can lead to pathophysiologic insights and potential therapeutic approaches within a broader spectrum of aplastic anemia cases",PubMed
Using LLMs to label medical papers according to the CIViC evidence model,"We introduce the sequence classification problem CIViC Evidence to the field of medical NLP. CIViC Evidence denotes the multi-label classification problem of assigning labels of clinical evidence to abstracts of scientific papers which have examined various combinations of genomic variants, cancer types, and treatment approaches. We approach CIViC Evidence using different language models: We fine-tune pretrained checkpoints of BERT and RoBERTa on the CIViC Evidence dataset and challenge their performance with models of the same architecture which have been pretrained on domain-specific text. In this context, we find that BiomedBERT and BioLinkBERT can outperform BERT on CIViC Evidence (+0.8% and +0.9% absolute improvement in class-support weighted F1 score). All transformer-based models show a clear performance edge when compared to a logistic regression trained on bigram tf-idf scores (+1.5 - 2.7% improved F1 score). We compare the aforementioned BERT-like models to OpenAI's GPT-4 in a few-shot setting (on a small subset of our original test dataset), demonstrating that, without additional prompt-engineering or fine-tuning, GPT-4 performs worse on CIViC Evidence than our six fine-tuned models (66.1% weighted F1 score compared to 71.8% for the best fine-tuned model). However, performance gets reasonably close to the benchmark of a logistic regression model trained on bigram tf-idf scores (67.7% weighted F1 score)",arXiv
Majeed syndrome: first description in a patient of central-European ancestry,"We present the first case of a Majeed syndrome in a girl of central-European ancestry. : Patient's medical records were reviewed. A NGS panel for autoinflammatory diseases was performed and the mutation was confirmed by Sanger analysis. Freshly isolated monocytes were activated with LPS +/- ATP. The concentration of inflammatory cytokines was assessed in monocytes supernatants. A 2-year-old girl presented with pain in the lower limbs, increase of acute phase reactants and persistent microcytic anaemia. The MRI showed bilateral STIR hyper-intensity of the spongy osseous tissue of femur, tibia, radius, ulna, and astragalus. Bone marrow analysis revealed increased trilinear cellularity with signs of dyserythropoietic anaemia. NGS panel detected the presence of two novel compound heterozygous mutations in the LPIN2 gene, confirmed by Sanger analysis. Treatment with anakinra was started with a prompt resolution of the clinical picture. Increased kinetics and concentration of IL-1β was observed in the patient's monocytes compared with healthy controls, with a marked drop following the start of therapy. About six months after the start of the therapy, resolution of MRI findings, microcytic anaemia and dyserythropoiesis at bone marrow aspirate was observed. We describe the first case of Majeed syndrome in a patient of central-European ancestry. The functional test on circulating monocytes before and after therapy with anakinra confirmed pathogenicity of the mutation and the role of LPIN2 in the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Anti-IL1 agents were effective, leading not only to the resolution of bone lesion but also to an improvement of dyserythropoiesis",PubMed
A Combined Manual Annotation and Deep-Learning Natural Language Processing Study on Accurate Entity Extraction in Hereditary Disease Related Biomedical Literature,"We report a combined manual annotation and deep-learning natural language processing study to make accurate entity extraction in hereditary disease related biomedical literature. A total of 400 full articles were manually annotated based on published guidelines by experienced genetic interpreters at Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). The performance of our manual annotations was assessed by comparing our re-annotated results with those publicly available. The overall Jaccard index was calculated to be 0.866 for the four entity types-gene, variant, disease and species. Both a BERT-based large name entity recognition (NER) model and a DistilBERT-based simplified NER model were trained, validated and tested, respectively. Due to the limited manually annotated corpus, Such NER models were fine-tuned with two phases. The F1-scores of BERT-based NER for gene, variant, disease and species are 97.28%, 93.52%, 92.54% and 95.76%, respectively, while those of DistilBERT-based NER are 95.14%, 86.26%, 91.37% and 89.92%, respectively. Most importantly, the entity type of variant has been extracted by a large language model for the first time and a comparable F1-score with the state-of-the-art variant extraction model tmVar has been achieved",PubMed
TaeC: A manually annotated text dataset for trait and phenotype extraction and entity linking in wheat breeding literature,"Wheat varieties show a large diversity of traits and phenotypes. Linking them to genetic variability is essential for shorter and more efficient wheat breeding programs. A growing number of plant molecular information networks provide interlinked interoperable data to support the discovery of gene-phenotype interactions. A large body of scientific literature and observational data obtained in-field and under controlled conditions document wheat breeding experiments. The cross-referencing of this complementary information is essential. Text from databases and scientific publications has been identified early on as a relevant source of information. However, the wide variety of terms used to refer to traits and phenotype values makes it difficult to find and cross-reference the textual information, e.g. simple dictionary lookup methods miss relevant terms. Corpora with manually annotated examples are thus needed to evaluate and train textual information extraction methods. While several corpora contain annotations of human and animal phenotypes, no corpus is available for plant traits. This hinders the evaluation of text mining-based crop knowledge graphs (e.g. AgroLD, KnetMiner, WheatIS-FAIDARE) and limits the ability to train machine learning methods and improve the quality of information. The Triticum aestivum trait Corpus is a new gold standard for traits and phenotypes of wheat. It consists of 528 PubMed references that are fully annotated by trait, phenotype, and species. We address the interoperability challenge of crossing sparse assay data and publications by using the Wheat Trait and Phenotype Ontology to normalize trait mentions and the species taxonomy of the National Center for Biotechnology Information to normalize species. The paper describes the construction of the corpus. A study of the performance of state-of-the-art language models for both named entity recognition and linking tasks trained on the corpus shows that it is suitable for training and evaluation. This corpus is currently the most comprehensive manually annotated corpus for natural language processing studies on crop phenotype information from the literature",PubMed
"Implementation of a culturally competent APOL1 genetic testing programme into living donor evaluation: A two-site, non-randomised, pre-post trial design","While living donor (LD) kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients with kidney failure, LDs assume a higher risk of future kidney failure themselves. LDs of African ancestry have an even greater risk of kidney failure post-donation than White LDs. Because evidence suggests that Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants contribute to this greater risk, transplant nephrologists are increasingly using APOL1 genetic testing to evaluate LD candidates of African ancestry. However, nephrologists do not consistently perform genetic counselling with LD candidates about APOL1 due to a lack of knowledge and skill in counselling. Without proper counselling, APOL1 testing will magnify LD candidates' decisional conflict about donating, jeopardising their informed consent. Given cultural concerns about genetic testing among people of African ancestry, protecting LD candidates' safety is essential to improve informed decisions about donating. Clinical 'chatbots', mobile apps that provide genetic information to patients, can improve informed treatment decisions. No chatbot on APOL1 is available and no nephrologist training programmes are available to provide culturally competent counselling to LDs about APOL1. Given the shortage of genetic counsellors, increasing nephrologists' genetic literacy is critical to integrating genetic testing into practice. Using a non-randomised, pre-post trial design in two transplant centres (Chicago, IL, and Washington, DC), we will evaluate the effectiveness of culturally competent APOL1 testing, chatbot and counselling on LD candidates' decisional conflict about donating, preparedness for decision-making, willingness to donate and satisfaction with informed consent and longitudinally evaluate the implementation of this intervention into clinical practice using the <u>R</u>each, <u>E</u>ffectiveness, <u>A</u>doption, <u>I</u>mplementation and <u>M</u>aintenance framework. This study will create a model for APOL1 testing of LDs of African ancestry, which can be implemented nationally via implementation science approaches. APOL1 will serve as a model for integrating culturally competent genetic testing into transplant and other practices to improve informed consent.

A self-supervised framework for learning whole slide representations,"Whole slide imaging is fundamental to biomedical microscopy and computational pathology. Previously, learning representations for gigapixel-sized whole slide images (WSIs) has relied on multiple instance learning with weak labels, which do not annotate the diverse morphologic features and spatial heterogeneity of WSIs. A high-quality self-supervised learning method for WSIs would provide transferable visual representations for downstream computational pathology tasks, without the need for dense annotations. We present Slide Pre-trained Transformers (SPT) for gigapixel-scale self-supervision of WSIs. Treating WSI patches as tokens, SPT combines data transformation strategies from language and vision modeling into a general and unified framework to generate views of WSIs for self-supervised pretraining. SPT leverages the inherent regional heterogeneity, histologic feature variability, and information redundancy within WSIs to learn high-quality whole slide representations. We benchmark SPT visual representations on five diagnostic tasks across three biomedical microscopy datasets. SPT significantly outperforms baselines for histopathologic diagnosis, cancer subtyping, and genetic mutation prediction. Finally, we demonstrate that SPT consistently improves whole slide representations when using off-the-shelf, in-domain, and foundational patch encoders for whole slide multiple instance learning",arXiv
Machine learning-based donor permission extraction from informed consent documents,"With more clinical trials are offering optional participation in the collection of bio-specimens for biobanking comes the increasing complexity of requirements of informed consent forms. The aim of this study is to develop an automatic natural language processing (NLP) tool to annotate informed consent documents to promote biorepository data regulation, sharing, and decision support. We collected informed consent documents from several publicly available sources, then manually annotated them, covering sentences containing permission information about the sharing of either bio-specimens or donor data, or conducting genetic research or future research using bio-specimens or donor data. We evaluated a variety of machine learning algorithms including random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) for the automatic identification of these sentences. 120 informed consent documents containing 29,204 sentences were annotated, of which 1250 sentences (4.28%) provide answers to a permission question. A support vector machine (SVM) model achieved a F-1 score of 0.95 on classifying the sentences when using a gold standard, which is a prefiltered corpus containing all relevant sentences. This study provides the feasibility of using machine learning tools to classify permission-related sentences in informed consent documents",PubMed
Accuracy of generative artificial intelligence models in differential diagnoses of familial Mediterranean fever and deficiency of Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist,"With the increasing development of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have been utilized to solve problems in natural language processing tasks. More recently, LLMs have shown unique potential in numerous applications within medicine but have been particularly investigated for their ability in clinical reasoning. Although the diagnostic accuracy of LLMs in forming differential diagnoses has been reviewed in general internal medicine applications, much is unknown in autoinflammatory disorders. From the nature of autoinflammatory diseases, forming a differential diagnosis is challenging due to the overlapping symptoms between disorders and even more difficult without genetic screening. In this work, the diagnostic accuracy of the Generative Pre-Trained Transformer Model-4 (GPT-4), GPT-3.5, and Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMa) were evaluated in clinical vignettes of Deficiency of Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (DIRA) and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). We then compared these models to a control group including one internal medicine physician. It was found that GPT-4 did not significantly differ in correctly identifying DIRA and FMF patients compared to the internist. However, the physician maintained a significantly higher accuracy than GPT-3.5 and LLaMa 2 for either disease. Overall, we explore and discuss the unique potential of LLMs in diagnostics for autoimmune diseases",PubMed
Enhancing human phenotype ontology term extraction through synthetic case reports and embedding-based retrieval: A novel approach for improved biomedical data annotation,"With the increasing utilization of exome and genome sequencing in clinical and research genetics, accurate and automated extraction of human phenotype ontology (HPO) terms from clinical texts has become imperative. Traditional methods for HPO term extraction, such as PhenoTagger, often face limitations in coverage and precision. In this study, we propose a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic sentences with clinical context, which were semantically encoded into vector embeddings. These embeddings are linked to HPO terms, creating a robust knowledgebase that facilitates precise information retrieval. Our method circumvents the known issue of LLM hallucinations by storing and querying these embeddings within a true database, ensuring accurate context matching without the need for a predictive model. We evaluated the performance of three different embedding models, all of which demonstrated substantial improvements over PhenoTagger. Top recall (sensitivity), precision (positive-predictive value, PPV), and F1 are 0.64, 0.64, and 0.64, respectively, which were 31%, 10%, and 21% better than PhenoTagger. Furthermore, optimal performance was achieved when we combined the best performing embedding model with PhenoTagger (a.k.a. Fused model), resulting in recall (sensitivity), precision (PPV), and F1 values of 0.7, 0.7, and 0.7, respectively, which are 10%, 10%, and 10% better than the best embedding models. Our findings underscore the potential of this integrated approach to enhance the precision and reliability of HPO term extraction, offering a scalable and effective solution for biomedical data annotation",PubMed
"A recently collected Xanthomonas translucens isolate encodes TAL effectors distinct from older, less virulent isolates","Xanthomonas translucens, the causal agent of bacterial leaf streak disease (BLS) in cereals, is a re-emerging pathogen that is becoming increasingly destructive across the world. While BLS has caused yield losses in the past, there is anecdotal evidence that newer isolates may be more virulent. We observed that two Xanthomonas translucens isolates collected from two sites in Colorado are more aggressive on current wheat and barley varieties compared to older isolates, and we hypothesize that genetic changes between recent and older isolates contribute to the differences in isolate aggressiveness. To test this, we phenotyped and genetically characterized two X. translucens isolates collected from Colorado in 2018, which we designated CO236 (from barley) and CO237 (from wheat). Using pathovar-specific phenotyping and PCR primers, we determined that CO236 belongs to pathovar translucens and CO237 belongs to pathovar undulosa. We sequenced the full genomes of the isolates using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing, and compared their whole genomes against published X. translucens genomes. This analysis confirmed our pathovar designations for Xtt CO236 and Xtu CO237, and showed that, at the whole-genome level, there were no obvious genomic structural changes between Xtt CO236 and Xtu CO237 and other respective published pathovar genomes. Focusing on pathovar undulosa (Xtu CO237), we then compared putative Type III effectors among all available Xtu isolate genomes and found that they were highly conserved. However, there were striking differences in the presence and sequence of various transcription activator-like effectors (TALE) between Xtu CO237 and published undulosa genomes, which correlate with isolate virulence. Here, we explore the potential implications of the differences in these virulence factors, and provide possible explanations for the increased virulence of recently-emerged isolates.  Data SummaryA list of all Xanthomonas accessions used in this study can be found in Supplemental Table S1. Xtt CO236 and Xtu CO237 genomic sequences are deposited in GenBank (Accession: PRJNA1017868 and PRJNA1017870, respectively). Software packages for the custom Conda environment used in this analysis can be found in Supplemental Table S4. The dataset from the MinION reads from CO236 and CO237 can be found in Dryad, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.d51c5b06q. Custom bash and Python scripts for the effector analysis are available in (https://github.com/robertslabcsu/xanthanalysis.git).  Impact statementXanthomonas translucens is a destructive, re-emerging pathogen of cereal crops with no known resistance or methods for chemical control. Recent isolates have increased virulence compared to older isolates, which emphasizes the need to understand how virulence evolves, and how the pathogen interacts with its host, to find new ways to manage the disease. Here, we identify potential virulence factors that contribute to the increased aggressiveness observed in two recently collected Colorado isolates, with potential impacts on understanding pathogen host range and evolution",biorxiv
