A Systematic Review of Testing and Evaluation of Healthcare Applications of Large Language Models (LLMs),"1ImportanceLarge Language Models (LLMs) can assist in a wide range of healthcare-related activities. Current approaches to evaluating LLMs make it difficult to identify the most impactful LLM application areas.  ObjectiveTo summarize the current evaluation of LLMs in healthcare in terms of 5 components: evaluation data type, healthcare task, Natural Language Processing (NLP)/Natural Language Understanding (NLU) task, dimension of evaluation, and medical specialty.  Data SourcesA systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science was performed for studies published between 01-01-2022 and 02-19-2024.  Study SelectionStudies evaluating one or more LLMs in healthcare.  Data Extraction and SynthesisThree independent reviewers categorized 519 studies in terms of data used in the evaluation, the healthcare tasks (the what) and the NLP/NLU tasks (the how) examined, the dimension(s) of evaluation, and the medical specialty studied.  ResultsOnly 5% of reviewed studies utilized real patient care data for LLM evaluation. The most popular healthcare tasks were assessing medical knowledge (e.g. answering medical licensing exam questions, 44.5%), followed by making diagnoses (19.5%), and educating patients (17.7%). Administrative tasks such as assigning provider billing codes (0.2%), writing prescriptions (0.2%), generating clinical referrals (0.6%) and clinical notetaking (0.8%) were less studied. For NLP/NLU tasks, the vast majority of studies examined question answering (84.2%). Other tasks such as summarization (8.9%), conversational dialogue (3.3%), and translation (3.1%) were infrequent. Almost all studies (95.4%) used accuracy as the primary dimension of evaluation; fairness, bias and toxicity (15.8%), robustness (14.8%), deployment considerations (4.6%), and calibration and uncertainty (1.2%) were infrequently measured. Finally, in terms of medical specialty area, most studies were in internal medicine (42%), surgery (11.4%) and ophthalmology (6.9%), with nuclear medicine (0.6%), physical medicine (0.4%) and medical genetics (0.2%) being the least represented.  Conclusions and RelevanceExisting evaluations of LLMs mostly focused on accuracy of question answering for medical exams, without consideration of real patient care data. Dimensions like fairness, bias and toxicity, robustness, and deployment considerations received limited attention. To draw meaningful conclusions and improve LLM adoption, future studies need to establish a standardized set of LLM applications and evaluation dimensions, perform evaluations using data from routine care, and broaden testing to include administrative tasks as well as multiple medical specialties.  Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow are healthcare applications of large language models (LLMs) currently evaluated?  FindingsStudies rarely used real patient care data for LLM evaluation. Administrative tasks such as generating provider billing codes and writing prescriptions were understudied. Natural Language Processing (NLP)/Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks like summarization, conversational dialogue, and translation were infrequently explored. Accuracy was the predominant dimension of evaluation, while fairness, bias and toxicity assessments were neglected. Evaluations in specialized fields, such as nuclear medicine and medical genetics were rare.  MeaningCurrent LLM assessments in healthcare remain shallow and fragmented. To draw concrete insights on their performance, evaluations need to use real patient care data across a broad range of healthcare and NLP/NLU tasks and medical specialties with standardized dimensions of evaluation",medrxiv
Genomic epidemiology of the primary methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clones causing invasive infections in Paraguayan children,"2.Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the major human pathogens, causing a wide range of infections from food poisoning to necrotizing pneumonia, endocarditis, or septicemia. It could carry numerous resistance genes and virulence factors, some of which are related to the severity of the infection, being also regarded as a potential ""Super Bug"". In Paraguay, the prevalence of CC30-ST30-IV clones is the leading cause of S. aureus infections both at the regional level and in pediatric population. Here we aimed to deeply analyze the genomic features of MRSA isolates that cause invasive infections in Paraguayan children. An observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study was designed to analyze representative MRSA isolates of the main clones identified between 2009 to 2013 in Paraguayan children. All the genetically linked MRSA isolates were recovered from diverse clinical sources, patients, and hospitals at broad gap periods. Cases were primarily community-acquired, which excludes in-hospital transmission or outbreaks. MRSA isolates were analyzed with short-read paired-end sequencing and assessed for the virulome, resistome, and phylogenetic relationships. The pan-genomic analysis of these clones revealed three major and different clonal complexes (CC8, CC30, and CC5), each composed of clones closely related to each other, despite having different spa types. Furthermore, multiple virulence and resistance genes were identified for the first time in this study, pointing out the complex virulence profiles of MRSA circulating in the country. This study opens a wide range of new possibilities for future projects and trials to improve the existing knowledge on the epidemiology of MRSA circulating in Paraguay.  3. Impact statementThe increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a public health problem worldwide. The most frequent MRSA clones identified in Paraguay in previous studies were (including community and hospital-acquired) the Pediatric (CC5-ST5-IV), the Cordobes-Chilean (CC5-ST5-I), the SouthWest Pacific (CC30-ST30-IV) and the Brazilian (CC8-ST239-III) clones. In this study, the pan-genomic analysis of the most representative MRSA clones circulating in invasive infection in Paraguayan children over ten years (2009-2019), such as the CC30-ST30-IV, CC5-ST5-IV, and CC8-ST8-IV, were carried out to evaluate their genetic diversity, their virulence factors repertoire, and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms revealed multiple virulences and resistance genes pointing out the complex virulence profiles of MRSA circulating in Paraguay. Our work is the first genomic study of MRSA in Paraguay and will contribute to the development of genomic surveillance in the region and our understanding of this pathogens global epidemiology.  4.

Diagnosing aceruloplasminemia: navigating through red herrings,"A 58-year-old female was found to have hyperferritinemia (Serum ferritin:1683 ng/mL) during work-up for mild normocytic anemia. Transferrin saturation(TSAT) was low-normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abdomen showed evidence of hepatic iron deposition. Liver biopsy showed 4 + hepatic iron deposition without any evidence of steatosis or fibrosis. Quantitative liver iron was elevated at 348.3 µmol/g dry liver weight [Reference range(RR): 3-33 µmol/g dry liver weight]. She was presumptively diagnosed with tissue iron overload, cause uncertain. A diagnosis of ferroportin disease (FD) was considered, but the pattern of iron distribution in the liver, mainly within the hepatic parenchyma (rather than in the hepatic Kupffer cells seen in FD), and the presence of anemia (uncommon in FD) made this less likely. She was treated with intermittent phlebotomy for over a decade with poor tolerance due to worsening normocytic to microcytic anemia. A trial of deferasirox was done but it was discontinued after a month due to significant side effects. During the course of treatment, her ferritin level decreased. Over the past 1.5 years, she developed progressively worsening neurocognitive decline. MRI brain showed areas of susceptibility involving basal ganglia, midbrain and cerebellum raising suspicion for metabolic deposition disease. Neuroimaging findings led to testing for serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels which were both found to be severely low. Low serum copper, ceruloplasmin levels and neuroimaging findings led us to consider Wilson disease however prior liver biopsy showing elevated hepatic iron rather than hepatic copper excluded the diagnosis of Wilson disease. After shared decision making, ceruloplasmin gene analysis was not pursued due to patient's preference and prohibitive cost of testing. The diagnosis of aceruloplasminemia was ultimately made. The biochemical triad of hyperferritinemia, low-normal TSAT and microcytic anemia should raise the possibility of aceruloplasminemia. Since neurological manifestations are rare in most inherited iron overload syndromes, neurological symptoms in a patient with tissue iron overload should prompt consideration of aceruloplasminemia as a differential diagnosis",PubMed
Genomic basis of adaptation to climate and parasite prevalence and the importance of odorant perception in the ant Temnothorax longispinosus,"A co-evolutionary arms race ensues when parasites exhibit exploitative behaviour, which prompts adaptations in their hosts, in turn triggering counter-adaptations by the parasites. To unravel the genomic basis of this coevolution from the host's perspective, we collected ants of the host species Temnothorax longispinosus, parasitized by the social parasite Temnothorax americanus, from 10 populations in the northeastern United States exhibiting varying levels of parasite prevalence and living under different climatic conditions. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with both prevalence and climate. Our investigation highlighted a multitude of candidate SNPs associated with parasite prevalence, particularly in genes responsible for sensory perception of smell including odorant receptor genes. We further focused on population-specific compositions of cuticular hydrocarbons, a complex trait important for signalling, communication and protection against desiccation. The relative abundances of n-alkanes were correlated with climate, while there was only a trend between parasite prevalence and the relative abundances of known recognition cues. Furthermore, we identified candidate genes likely involved in the synthesis and recognition of specific hydrocarbons. In addition, we analysed the population-level gene expression in the antennae, the primary organ for odorant reception, and established a strong correlation with parasite prevalence. Our comprehensive study highlights the intricate genomic patterns forged by the interplay of diverse selection factors and how these are manifested in the expression of various phenotypes",PubMed
Modeling cancer dependency with deep graph models,"A fundamental premise for precision oncology is a catalog of diverse actionable targets that could enable personalized treatment. Large scale Genome-wide lost-of-function screens such as cancer dependency map have systematically identified single gene vulnerabilities in numerous cell lines. However, it remains challenging to scale such analyses to many clinical samples and untangle molecular networks underlying observed vulnerabilities. We developed a deep learning framework, DepGPS, combing graph neural networks with transformers to model the network interactions underlying tumor vulnerabilities. Our model demonstrated an improved ability to predict context-specific vulnerabilities over existing models and showed a higher responsiveness in perturbation analysis. Furthermore, perturbation induced dependency changes by our model demonstrated utility to support context-aware identification of synthetic lethal genes. Overall, our model represents a valuable tool to extend tumor vulnerability analyses to broader range of subjects and could help to decipher molecular networks dictating context-specific tumor vulnerabilities",biorxiv
Extramedullary plasmacytoma with associated multiple myeloma as a presentation of the posterior mediastinal mass: a rare clinical encounter,"A plasmacytoma is a single, isolated tumour of abnormal plasma cells. It can develop within the bone, known as solitary plasmacytoma of bone, or outside the bone, referred to as extraosseous (extramedullary) plasmacytoma, without spreading to other parts of the body. Plasmacytoma, an uncommon presentation in the posterior mediastinum, usually arises as solitary or multiple lesions in bone or soft tissues. The standard treatment involves definitive radiotherapy, potentially curative for extramedullary cases. The prognosis varies, being more favourable without concurrent multiple myeloma and worsening with high-risk cytogenetics. The case involves a male in his early 80s with an extensive medical history presenting with difficulty swallowing and dyspnoea. The diagnosis revealed a rare posterior mediastinal plasmacytoma associated with multiple myeloma, emphasising the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment",PubMed
Disorders with Ophthalmic and Thoracic Involvement,"A variety of systemic conditions involve the thorax and the eyes. While subtle or nonspecific eye symptoms can be the initial clinical manifestation of some disorders, there can be additional manifestations in the thorax that lead to a specific diagnosis and affect patient outcomes. For instance, the initial clinical manifestation of Sjögren syndrome is dry eye or xerophthalmia; however, the presence of Sjögren lung disease represents a fourfold increase in mortality. Likewise, patients with acute sarcoidosis can initially present with pain and redness of the eye from uveitis in addition to fever and parotitis. Nearly 90% of patients with sarcoidosis have thoracic involvement, and the ophthalmologic symptoms can precede the thoracic symptoms by several years in some cases. Furthermore, a diagnosis made in one system can result in the screening of other organs as well as prompt genetic evaluation and examination of family members, such as in the setting of Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Multimodality imaging, particularly CT and MRI, plays a vital role in identification and characterization of these conditions. While it is helpful for ophthalmologists to be knowledgeable about these conditions and their associations so that they can order the pertinent radiologic studies, it is also important for radiologists to use the clues from ophthalmologic examination in addition to imaging findings to suggest a specific diagnosis. Systemic conditions with thoracic and ophthalmologic manifestations can be categorized as infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, neoplastic, or hereditary in origin. The authors describe a spectrum of these conditions based on their underlying cause. <sup>©</sup>RSNA, 2024",PubMed
"Virtual Labs and Designer Bugs - Generative AI, Synthetic Biology and National Security","AI technologies can pose a major national security concern. AI programs could be used to develop chemical and biological agents which circumvent existing protective measures or medical treatments, or to design pathogens with capabilities they do not naturally possess (gain-of-function research). Although Australia has a strong legislative framework relating to research into genetically modified organisms, the framework requires the interaction of more than 10 different government departments, universities and funding agencies. Further, there are few guidelines about the responsible use of AI in biological research where existing laws and policies do not apply to research that is conducted ""virtually"", even where that research may have national security implications. This article explores these under-scrutinised concepts in Australia's biological security frameworks",PubMed

PhenoID, a language model normalizer of physical examinations from genetics clinical notes","AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSPhenotypes identified during dysmorphology physical examinations are critical to genetic diagnosis and nearly universally documented as free-text in the electronic health record (EHR). Variation in how phenotypes are recorded in free-text makes large-scale computational analysis extremely challenging. Existing natural language processing (NLP) approaches to address phenotype extraction are trained largely on the biomedical literature or on case vignettes rather than actual EHR data.  MethodsWe implemented a tailored system at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelpia that allows clinicians to document dysmorphology physical exam findings. From the underlying data, we manually annotated a corpus of 3136 organ system observations using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). We provide this corpus publicly. We trained a transformer based NLP system to identify HPO terms from exam observations. The pipeline includes an extractor, which identifies tokens in the sentence expected to contain an HPO term, and a normalizer, which uses those tokens together with the original observation to determine the specific term mentioned.  FindingsWe find that our labeler and normalizer NLP pipeline, which we call PhenoID, achieves state-of-the-art performance for the dysmorphology physical exam phenotype extraction task. PhenoIDs performance on the test set was 0.717, compared to the nearest baseline system (Pheno-Tagger) performance of 0.633. An analysis of our systems normalization errors shows possible imperfections in the HPO terminology itself but also reveals a lack of semantic understanding by our transformer models.  InterpretationTransformers-based NLP models are a promising approach to genetic phenotype extraction and, with recent development of larger pre-trained causal language models, may improve semantic understanding in the future. We believe our results also have direct applicability to more general extraction of medical signs and symptoms.  FundingUS National Institutes of Health",medrxiv
APOGEE 2: multi-layer machine-learning model for the interpretable prediction of mitochondrial missense variants,"APOGEE 2 is a mitochondrially-centered ensemble method designed to improve the accuracy of pathogenicity predictions for interpreting missense mitochondrial variants. Built on the joint consensus recommendations by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP), APOGEE 2 features an improved machine learning method and a curated training set for enhanced performance metrics. It offers region-wise assessments of genome fragility and mechanistic analyses of specific amino acids that cause perceptible long-range effects on protein structure. With clinical and research use in mind, APOGEE 2 scores and pathogenicity probabilities are precompiled and available in MitImpact. APOGEE 2s ability to address challenges in interpreting mitochondrial missense variants makes it an essential tool in the field of mitochondrial genetics",biorxiv
Coincidence of acral peeling skin syndrome and Nagashima-type palmoplantar keratosis in a Japanese pedigree with acral skin peeling,"Acral peeling skin syndrome (APSS; MIM 609796) is a rare genodermatosis characterized by painless focal cutaneous exfoliation of the dorsal hands and feet, typically displaying autosomal recessive inheritance. While cases associated with a founder mutation in TGM5 are relatively common in European Caucasian populations, no APSS cases have been reported from Japan or other East Asian countries. In contrast, Nagashima-type palmoplantar keratosis (NPPK; MIM 615598), caused by variants in SERPINB7, is relatively common in East Asia due to founder mutations. We describe a 27-year-old Japanese woman with spontaneous focal cutaneous exfoliation of the dorsal hand following prolonged glove use, indicative of APSS. Histopathological examination revealed a cleft between the stratum corneum and stratum granulosum and within the horny layer of the epidermis, supporting this diagnosis. However, her mother and maternal uncle exhibited similar symptoms, and there was no reported consanguinity in the patient's parents or grandparents, prompting suspicion of an autosomal dominant genodermatosis. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) revealed compound heterozygous variants in TGM5 (c.1037G>A and c.684 + 1G>A) as suspected causative variants in the patient, leading to an APSS diagnosis, the first reported in East Asia. On the other hand, her mother and maternal uncle were diagnosed with NPPK due to compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in SERPINB7 (c.796C>T and c.455-1G>A). This case highlights the complexity of diagnosing skin disorders when multiple genodermatoses with similar phenotypes exist within a pedigree. Comprehensive genetic analyses, such as whole-exome sequencing and WGS, are invaluable for identifying causative variants in such complex cases",PubMed
Optimizing Acute Ischemic Stroke Outcomes: The Role of Tenecteplase Before Mechanical Thrombectomy,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a life-threatening condition demanding prompt reperfusion to salvage brain tissue. Thrombolytic drugs, like tenecteplase (TNK), offer clot dissolution, but time constraints and contraindications limit their use. Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) revolutionized AIS treatment, especially for large vessel occlusions (LVO). Recent evidence suggests that administering TNK before MT improves recanalization and outcomes, challenging the dominance of alteplase. Relevant articles focusing on TNK before MT were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, looking for randomized controlled trials (RCT), clinical trials, and meta-analyses in humans until 2024. TNK, a genetically engineered thrombolytic, exhibits superior fibrin specificity and a longer half-life than alteplase. Clinical trials comparing TNK and alteplase before MT showcase enhanced recanalization, functional outcomes, and safety with TNK. Advanced neuroimaging aids patient selection, though its cost-effectiveness warrants consideration. Dosing studies favor a 0.25 mg/kg dose for efficacy and reduced complications. Clinical guidelines from various associations acknowledge TNK's potential as an alteplase alternative for AIS treatment, particularly for LVOs eligible for thrombectomy. In conclusion, TNK emerges as a promising option for bridging therapy in AIS, displaying efficacy and safety benefits, especially when administered before MT. Its fibrin specificity, longer half-life, and potential for improved outcomes position TNK as a viable alternative to alteplase, potentially transforming the landscape of AIS treatment strategies. While limitations like small sample sizes and variations in protocols exist, future research should focus on large-scale RCT, subgroup analyses, and cost-effectiveness evaluations to further elucidate TNK's role in optimizing AIS management",PubMed
Human spinal interneurons repair the injured spinal cord through synaptic integration,"Advances in cell therapy offer promise for some of the most devastating neural injuries, including spinal cord injury (SCI). Endogenous VSX2-expressing spinal V2a interneurons have been implicated as a key component in plasticity and therapeutically driven recovery post-SCI. While transplantation of generic V2a neurons may have therapeutic value, generation of human spinal V2a neurons with rostro-caudal specificity and assessment of their functional synaptic integration with the injured spinal cord has been elusive. Here, we efficiently differentiated optogenetically engineered cervical V2a spinal interneurons (SpINs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells and tested their capacity to form functional synapses with injured diaphragm motor networks in a clinically-relevant sub-acute model of cervical contusion injury. Neuroanatomical tracing and immunohistochemistry demonstrated transplant integration and synaptic connectivity with injured host tissue. Optogenetic activation of transplanted human V2a SpINs revealed functional synaptic connectivity to injured host circuits, culminating in improved diaphragm activity assessed by electromyography. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of host supraspinal pathways revealed functional innervation of transplanted cells by host neurons, which also led to enhanced diaphragm contraction indicative of a functional neuronal relay. Single cell analyses pre- and post-transplantation suggested the in vivo environment resulted in maturation of cervical SpINs that mediate the formation of neuronal relays, as well as differentiation of glial progenitors involved in repair of the damaged spinal cord. This study rigorously demonstrates feasibility of generating human cervical spinal V2a interneurons that develop functional host-transplant and transplant-host connectivity resulting in improved muscle activity post-SCI",biorxiv
The role of Immune cells in Alzheimer's disease: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia, characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, leading to neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. The role of the immune system in AD pathogenesis is increasingly recognized, prompting an exploration of the causal relationship between immune cells and AD by using Mendelian randomization (MR) approaches. Utilizing genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from European cohorts, we conducted an MR study to investigate the causal links between immune cell phenotypes and AD. We selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with immune cell traits at a genome-wide significance threshold and applied various MR methods, including MR Egger, Weighted median, and inverse variance weighted analysis, to assess the causality between 731 immune phenotypes and AD. Our MR analysis identified 15 immune cell types with significant causal relationships to AD pathogenesis. Notably, the absolute count of CD28<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> T cells and the expression of HLA DR on B cells were linked to a protective effect against AD, while 13 other immune phenotypes were identified as contributing to the risk factors for the disease. The causal effects of AD on immunophenotypic traits are predominantly negative, implying that AD may impair the functionality of immune cells. Validation through independent datasets, such as FinnGen and GCST90027158, confirmed the causal association between six specific immune cells and AD. This comprehensive MR study elucidates the intricate network of causal relationships between diverse immunophenotypic traits and AD, providing novel insights into the immunopathogenesis of AD. The findings suggest potential immunological targets that could be leveraged for early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and therapeutic intervention",PubMed
Identifying Progression-Specific Alzheimer's Subtypes Using Multimodal Transformer,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, yet its current treatments are limited to stopping disease progression. Moreover, the effectiveness of these treatments remains uncertain due to the heterogeneity of the disease. Therefore, it is essential to identify disease subtypes at a very early stage. Current data-driven approaches can be used to classify subtypes during later stages of AD or related disorders, but making predictions in the asymptomatic or prodromal stage is challenging. Furthermore, the classifications of most existing models lack explainability, and these models rely solely on a single modality for assessment, limiting the scope of their analysis. Thus, we propose a multimodal framework that utilizes early-stage indicators, including imaging, genetics, and clinical assessments, to classify AD patients into progression-specific subtypes at an early stage. In our framework, we introduce a tri-modal co-attention mechanism (Tri-COAT) to explicitly capture cross-modal feature associations. Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (slow progressing = 177, intermediate = 302, and fast = 15) were used to train and evaluate Tri-COAT using a 10-fold stratified cross-testing approach. Our proposed model outperforms baseline models and sheds light on essential associations across multimodal features supported by known biological mechanisms. The multimodal design behind Tri-COAT allows it to achieve the highest classification area under the receiver operating characteristic curve while simultaneously providing interpretability to the model predictions through the co-attention mechanism",PubMed
Multimodal Neurodegenerative Disease Subtyping Explained by ChatGPT,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease; yet its currently available treatments are limited to stopping disease progression. Moreover, effectiveness of these treatments is not guaranteed due to the heterogenetiy of the disease. Therefore, it is essential to be able to identify the disease subtypes at a very early stage. Current data driven approaches are able to classify the subtypes at later stages of AD or related disorders, but struggle when predicting at the asymptomatic or prodromal stage. Moreover, most existing models either lack explainability behind the classification or only use a single modality for the assessment, limiting scope of its analysis. Thus, we propose a multimodal framework that uses early-stage indicators such as imaging, genetics and clinical assessments to classify AD patients into subtypes at early stages. Similarly, we build prompts and use large language models, such as ChatGPT, to interpret the findings of our model. In our framework, we propose a tri-modal co-attention mechanism (Tri-COAT) to explicitly learn the cross-modal feature associations. Our proposed model outperforms baseline models and provides insight into key cross-modal feature associations supported by known biological mechanisms",arXiv
Comprehensive Overview of Alzheimer's Disease: Etiological Insights and Degradation Strategies,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and affects millions of individuals globally. AD is associated with cognitive decline and memory loss that worsens with aging. A statistical report using U.S. data on AD estimates that approximately 6.9 million individuals suffer from AD, a number projected to surge to 13.8 million by 2060. Thus, there is a critical imperative to pinpoint and address AD and its hallmark tau protein aggregation early to prevent and manage its debilitating effects. Amyloid-β and tau proteins are primarily associated with the formation of plaques and neurofibril tangles in the brain. Current research efforts focus on degrading amyloid-β and tau or inhibiting their synthesis, particularly targeting APP processing and tau hyperphosphorylation, aiming to develop effective clinical interventions. However, navigating this intricate landscape requires ongoing studies and clinical trials to develop treatments that truly make a difference. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) across various cohorts identified 40 loci and over 300 genes associated with AD. Despite this wealth of genetic data, much remains to be understood about the functions of these genes and their role in the disease process, prompting continued investigation. By delving deeper into these genetic associations, novel targets such as kinases, proteases, cytokines, and degradation pathways, offer new directions for drug discovery and therapeutic intervention in AD. This review delves into the intricate biological pathways disrupted in AD and identifies how genetic variations within these pathways could serve as potential targets for drug discovery and treatment strategies. Through a comprehensive understanding of the molecular underpinnings of AD, researchers aim to pave the way for more effective therapies that can alleviate the burden of this devastating disease",PubMed
Androgenic alopecia is associated with higher dietary inflammatory index and lower antioxidant index scores,"Androgenic alopecia (AGA), the most prevalent hair loss type, causes major psychological distress and reduced quality of life. A definite and safe cure/prevention for this condition is still lacking. The role of oxidative stress and inflammation in AGA pathogenesis prompted us to investigate the association between dietary antioxidant index (DAI) and energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index (E-DII) with AGA. The investigation was designed based on data from 10,138 participants from the Fasa Adult Cohort Study (FACS). DAI and energy-adjusted DII (E-DII) were calculated utilizing a validated 125-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). A physician diagnosed AGA. Logistic regression models were utilized to evaluate the association of DAI and E-DII with AGA. After exclusion, 9,647 participants (44.0% men, mean age: 48.6 ± 9.5 years) consisting of 7,348 participants with AGA entered the analyses. Higher DAI was associated with 10% lower AGA odds, while higher E-DII showed 4% higher AGA odds after adjusting for various confounding variables. However, significant associations were found only among women, and adjusting for metabolic syndrome (MetS) made the E-DII-AGA association insignificant. Antioxidant-rich diets protect against AGA, while pro-inflammatory diets increase the risk, likely through developing MetS. Patient nutrition is frequently overlooked in clinical practice, yet it plays a crucial role, especially for women genetically predisposed to androgenetic alopecia. Dietary changes, such as reducing pro-inflammatory foods (like trans and saturated fats) and increasing anti-inflammatory options (fruits and vegetables), can help prevent hair loss and mitigate its psychological impacts, ultimately lowering future treatment costs",PubMed
Rapid in vitro activity of telavancin against Bacillus anthracis and in vivo protection against inhalation anthrax infection in the rabbit model,"Anthrax, caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, is a zoonotic disease that manifests in various forms in human infection, depending on the route of infection. Inhalation anthrax, the most detrimental form of the disease, comes about from the inhalation of anthrax spores and progresses to severe life-threatening conditions late in infection. Notably, there are FDA-approved antibiotics that are effective at treating the disease when administered promptly; however, these antibiotics would be rendered useless against strains of B. anthracis that were genetically modified to be resistant to these antibiotics. Consequently, the search for new and effective therapeutics to combat anthrax infection continues. In this study, telavancin (Vibativ(R)), a semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, was assessed for in vitro activity against 17 B. anthracis strains and tested for the protective efficacy against inhalation anthrax infection in the rabbit model. Telavancin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against B. anthracis which led us to test its efficacy in the rabbit inhalation anthrax model. Rabbits were infected with a lethal dose of anthrax spores via the inhalation route and treated intravenously with telavancin at 30 mg/kg every 12 hours, a dose that mimics the levels measured in the serum of humans, for 5 days upon detection of antigenemia. Blood samples were collected at various times post-infection to assess the level of bacteremia and antibody production, and tissues were collected to determine bacterial load. The animals body temperatures were also recorded. Telavancin conveyed 100% survival in this model. Moreover, the dosage of telavancin used for the study effectively cleared B. anthracis from the bloodstream and organ tissues, even more effectively than a humanized dose of levofloxacin. Collectively, the low MICs against all strains tested and rapid bactericidal in vivo activity demonstrate that telavancin has the potential to be an effective alternative for the treatment or prophylaxis of anthrax infection.  Author SummaryBacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, continues to interest the research community due to its past and future potential use as bioweapon. Importantly, as a bacterial pathogen, B. anthracis is capable of developing resistance to the antibiotics currently used to treat the infection, either naturally or by deliberate, nefarious means. Consequently, there remains a need to discover, develop, and/or repurpose new antibiotics that would be effective at treating anthrax infection. In this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity of telavancin, a semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotic clinically approved to treat complicated skin and skin structure infections, against various strains of B. anthracis in vitro, and we assessed the protective efficacy of telavancin against inhalation anthrax infection in the rabbit model. We show that telavancin is very potent against numerous B. anthracis strains in vitro, and its level of potency surpassed that of another antibiotic currently approved and used to prevent anthrax infection. Moreover, we show that telavancin protects against inhalation anthrax infection in vivo. Overall, our findings support the use of telavancin as an effective therapeutic for anthrax infection",biorxiv
Unraveling the Enigma of Aortic Dissection: From Genetics to Innovative Therapies,"Aortic dissection (AD) presents a critical medical emergency characterized by a tear in the aortic wall, necessitating prompt recognition and management to mitigate catastrophic complications. Despite advancements in medical technology and therapeutic interventions, AD remains a formidable challenge, often resulting in severe morbidity and mortality. This narrative review provides a comprehensive overview of AD, encompassing its clinical presentation, diagnostic modalities, and management strategies, while also exploring emerging trends and innovations in its management. Genetic predispositions significantly influence AD pathogenesis, with over 30 contributory genes identified, emphasizing the importance of genetic screening and counseling. Classification systems such as Stanford and DeBakey, alongside their revised counterparts, aid in categorizing AD and guiding treatment decisions. Advancements in diagnostic imaging, including transesophageal echocardiography and computed tomography angiography, have enhanced diagnostic precision, augmented by artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. Pharmacological innovations focus on optimizing medical therapy, while surgical and endovascular approaches offer minimally invasive treatment options. Hybrid procedures and aortic valve-sparing techniques broaden treatment avenues, while bioresorbable stent grafts hold promise for tissue regeneration. Collaborative efforts and ongoing research are essential to address remaining challenges and improve outcomes in managing AD. This review contributes to the understanding of AD's complexity and facilitates informed decision-making in clinical practice, underscoring the imperative for continued innovation and research in AD management",PubMed
Diagnosis and management of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy: a case report,"Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is a genetically determined myocardial atrophy which progressively extends from the epicardium towards the endocardium, resulting in wall thinning. It is one of the leading causes of sudden death in young people. Postmortem studies demonstrate that up to 70-80% of the cases have biventricular involvement. Variable penetrance and expressivity results in a wide phenotypic spectrum, challenging diagnostic accuracy of advanced multimodality imaging tools. Prompt recognition, non-invasive imaging, risk stratification for sudden cardiac death (SCD), and preventive measures are paramount to improve prognosis. Here, we present a 22-year-old Black male who was referred to our electrophysiology clinic with palpitations, remote syncope, and a family history of SCD. Over 3 years, he developed gradually worsening symptomatic palpitations. While physical exam and transthoracic echocardiography were unremarkable, his cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was consistent with biventricular ACM. Genetic testing confirmed ACM, revealing double heterozygosity in DSG2 and PKP2. Given the elevated estimated risk of life-threatening dysrhythmias, a subcutaneous cardiac defibrillator was successfully implanted. Frequently, patients with ACM have more than one mutation in the same gene (compound heterozygosity) or in a second gene (double heterozygosity). Genetic counselling is strongly recommended for family members of the proband. The diagnosis of ACM may be mimicked by other diseases (cardiac sarcoidosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, amyloidosis), thus genetic testing can be useful to determine the presence of the disease. The present report provides an overview of the clinical course, diagnostic criteria, risk stratification, and prognostication for patients with ACM",PubMed
ChatGPT accurately performs genetic counseling for gynecologic cancers,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems such as ChatGPT can take medical examinations and counsel patients regarding medical diagnosis. We aim to quantify the accuracy of the ChatGPT V3.4 in answering commonly asked questions pertaining to genetic testing and counseling for gynecologic cancers. Forty questions were formulated in conjunction with gynecologic oncologists and adapted from professional society guidelines and ChatGPT version 3.5 was queried, the version that is readily available to the public. The two categories of questions were genetic counseling guidelines and questions pertaining to specific genetic disorders. The answers were scored by two attending Gynecologic Oncologists according to the following scale: 1) correct and comprehensive, 2) correct but not comprehensive, 3) some correct, some incorrect, and 4) completely incorrect. Scoring discrepancies were resolved by additional third reviewer. The proportion of responses earning each score were calculated overall and within each question category. ChatGPT provided correct and comprehensive answers to 33/40 (82.5%) questions, correct but not comprehensive answers to 6/40 (15%) questions, partially incorrect answers to 1/40 (2.5%) questions, and completely incorrect answers to 0/40 (0%) questions. The genetic counseling category of questions had the highest proportion of answers that were both correct and comprehensive with ChatGPT answering all 20/20 questions with 100% accuracy and were comprehensive in responses. ChatGPT performed equally in the specific genetic disorders category, with 88.2% (15/17) and 66.6% (2/3) correct and comprehensive answers to questions pertaining to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and Lynch syndrome questions respectively. ChatGPT accurately answers questions about genetic syndromes, genetic testing, and counseling in majority of the studied questions. These data suggest this powerful tool can be utilized as a patient resource for genetic counseling questions, though more data input from gynecologic oncologists would be needed to educate patients on genetic syndromes",PubMed
Approximating facial expression effects on diagnostic accuracy via generative AI in medical genetics,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in genomics research and practice, and generative AI has garnered significant recent attention. In clinical applications of generative AI, aspects of the underlying datasets can impact results, and confounders should be studied and mitigated. One example involves the facial expressions of people with genetic conditions. Stereotypically, Williams (WS) and Angelman (AS) syndromes are associated with a ""happy"" demeanor, including a smiling expression. Clinical geneticists may be more likely to identify these conditions in images of smiling individuals. To study the impact of facial expression, we analyzed publicly available facial images of approximately 3500 individuals with genetic conditions. Using a deep learning (DL) image classifier, we found that WS and AS images with non-smiling expressions had significantly lower prediction probabilities for the correct syndrome labels than those with smiling expressions. This was not seen for 22q11.2 deletion and Noonan syndromes, which are not associated with a smiling expression. To further explore the effect of facial expressions, we computationally altered the facial expressions for these images. We trained HyperStyle, a GAN-inversion technique compatible with StyleGAN2, to determine the vector representations of our images. Then, following the concept of InterfaceGAN, we edited these vectors to recreate the original images in a phenotypically accurate way but with a different facial expression. Through online surveys and an eye-tracking experiment, we examined how altered facial expressions affect the performance of human experts. We overall found that facial expression is associated with diagnostic accuracy variably in different genetic conditions",PubMed
Innovations in Medicine: Exploring ChatGPT's Impact on Rare Disorder Management,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the field of medicine, announcing a new era of innovation and efficiency. Among AI programs designed for general use, ChatGPT holds a prominent position, using an innovative language model developed by OpenAI. Thanks to the use of deep learning techniques, ChatGPT stands out as an exceptionally viable tool, renowned for generating human-like responses to queries. Various medical specialties, including rheumatology, oncology, psychiatry, internal medicine, and ophthalmology, have been explored for ChatGPT integration, with pilot studies and trials revealing each field's potential benefits and challenges. However, the field of genetics and genetic counseling, as well as that of rare disorders, represents an area suitable for exploration, with its complex datasets and the need for personalized patient care. In this review, we synthesize the wide range of potential applications for ChatGPT in the medical field, highlighting its benefits and limitations. We pay special attention to rare and genetic disorders, aiming to shed light on the future roles of AI-driven chatbots in healthcare. Our goal is to pave the way for a healthcare system that is more knowledgeable, efficient, and centered around patient needs",PubMed
Generative Artificial Intelligence Methods for Pediatric Genetics Education,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in an increasing number of areas, with recent interest in generative AI, such as using ChatGPT to generate programming code or DALL-E to make illustrations. We describe the use of generative AI in medical education. Specifically, we sought to determine whether generative AI could help train pediatric residents to better recognize genetic conditions. From publicly available images of individuals with genetic conditions, we used generative AI methods to create new images, which were checked for accuracy with an external classifier. We selected two conditions for study, Kabuki (KS) and Noonan (NS) syndromes, which are clinically important conditions that pediatricians may encounter. In this study, pediatric residents completed 208 surveys, where they each classified 20 images following exposure to one of 4 possible educational interventions, including with and without generative AI methods. Overall, we find that generative images perform similarly but appear to be slightly less helpful than real images. Most participants reported that images were useful, although real images were felt to be more helpful. We conclude that generative AI images may serve as an adjunctive educational tool, particularly for less familiar conditions, such as KS",medrxiv
Aspergillus flavus pangenome (AflaPan) uncovers novel aflatoxin and secondary metabolite associated gene clusters,"Aspergillus flavus is an important agricultural and food safety threat due to its production of carcinogenic aflatoxins. It has high level of genetic diversity that is adapted to various environments. Recently, we reported two reference genomes of A. flavus isolates, AF13 (MAT1-2 and highly aflatoxigenic isolate) and NRRL3357 (MAT1-1 and moderate aflatoxin producer). Where, an insertion of 310 kb in AF13 included an aflatoxin producing gene bZIP transcription factor, named atfC. Observations of significant genomic variants between these isolates of contrasting phenotypes prompted an investigation into variation among other agricultural isolates of A. flavus with the goal of discovering novel genes potentially associated with aflatoxin production regulation. Present study was designed with three main objectives: (1) collection of large number of A. flavus isolates from diverse sources including maize plants and field soils; (2) whole genome sequencing of collected isolates and development of a pangenome; and (3) pangenome-wide association study (Pan-GWAS) to identify novel secondary metabolite cluster genes. Pangenome analysis of 346 A. flavus isolates identified a total of 17,855 unique orthologous gene clusters, with mere 41% (7,315) core genes and 59% (10,540) accessory genes indicating accumulation of high genomic diversity during domestication. 5,994 orthologous gene clusters in accessory genome not annotated in either the A. flavus AF13 or NRRL3357 reference genomes. Pan-genome wide association analysis of the genomic variations identified 391 significant associated pan-genes associated with aflatoxin production. Interestingly, most of the significantly associated pan-genes (94%; 369 associations) belonged to accessory genome indicating that genome expansion has resulted in the incorporation of new genes associated with aflatoxin and other secondary metabolites. In summary, this study provides complete pangenome framework for the species of Aspergillus flavus along with associated genes for pathogen survival and aflatoxin production. The large accessory genome indicated large genome diversity in the species A. flavus, however AflaPan is a closed pangenome represents optimum diversity of species A. flavus. Most importantly, the newly identified aflatoxin producing gene clusters will be a new source for seeking aflatoxin mitigation strategies and needs new attention in research",PubMed
Suboptimal dietary patterns are associated with accelerated biological aging in young adulthood: a twin study,"Background & aimsSuboptimal diets increase morbidity and mortality risk. Epigenetic clocks are algorithms that can assess health and lifespan, even at a young age, before clinical manifestations of diseases. We investigated the association between dietary patterns and biological aging in young adult twins.  MethodsThe data were drawn from the population-based FinnTwin12 study and consisted of twins aged 21-25 years (n=826). Food and beverage intakes were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Biological aging was estimated using the epigenetic clocks GrimAge and DunedinPACE. Latent class analysis was used to identify dietary patterns. The association between dietary patterns and biological aging was assessed using linear regression modeling at the individual level, followed by within-twin pair analyses to account for genetic liabilities and shared familial confounders.  ResultsSix dietary patterns were identified: 1) High fast food, low fruits and vegetables (F&V), 2) Plant-based, 3) Health-conscious, 4) Western with infrequent fish, 5) Western with regular fish, and 6) Balanced average. At the individual level, GrimAge acceleration was slower in the Plant-based, Health-conscious, and Balanced-average patterns compared to the High fast food, low F&V, and faster in the Western with infrequent fish pattern compared to the Balanced average, regardless of sex, nonalcoholic energy intake, smoking, and alcohol consumption. After further adjustment for BMI and sports participation, the strengths of the associations modestly decreased; however, the difference between the Balanced-average and High fast food, low F&V patterns remained significant. The pace of aging (DunedinPACE) was slower in the Plant-based pattern compared to the High fast food, low F&V and the Western with infrequent fish patterns after adjustment for sex, nonalcoholic energy intake, smoking, and alcohol. The effect sizes were attenuated and reached a non-significant level when BMI and sports participation were added to the model. Most of the associations were replicated in the within-pair analyses among all twin pairs and among dizygotic twin pairs, but the effect sizes tended to be smaller among monozygotic twin pairs. This suggests that genetics, but not a shared environment, may partially explain the observed associations between diet and biological aging.  ConclusionDiets high in fast food, processed red meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages and low in fruits and vegetables are associated with accelerated biological aging in young adulthood. The clustering effect of lifestyle factors and genetic confounders should be considered when interpreting the findings",medrxiv
Chatbot for the Return of Positive Genetic Screening Results for Hereditary Cancer Syndromes: a Prompt Engineering Study,"Background The growing demand for genomic testing and limited access to experts necessitate innovative service models. While chatbots have shown promise in supporting genomic services like pre-test counseling, their use in returning positive genetic results, especially using the more recent large language models (LLMs) remains unexplored. Objective This study reports the prompt engineering process and intrinsic evaluation of the LLM component of a chatbot designed to support returning positive population-wide genomic screening results. Methods We used a three-step prompt engineering process, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and few-shot techniques to develop an open-response chatbot. This was then evaluated using two hypothetical scenarios, with experts rating its performance using a 5-point Likert scale across eight criteria: tone, clarity, program accuracy, domain accuracy, robustness, efficiency, boundaries, and usability. Results The chatbot achieved an overall score of 3.88 out of 5 across all criteria and scenarios. The highest ratings were in Tone (4.25), Usability (4.25), and Boundary management (4.0), followed by Efficiency (3.88), Clarity and Robustness (3.81), and Domain Accuracy (3.63). The lowest-rated criterion was Program Accuracy, which scored 3.25. Discussion The LLM handled open-ended queries and maintained boundaries, while the lower Program Accuracy rating indicates areas for improvement. Future work will focus on refining prompts, expanding evaluations, and exploring optimal hybrid chatbot designs that integrate LLM components with rule-based chatbot components to enhance genomic service delivery",PubMed
Multidimensional and Longitudinal Impact of a Genetic Diagnosis for Critically Ill Infants,"Background and ObjectivesMany genetic conditions present in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), where a diagnostic evaluation is pursued. However, understanding of the impact of a genetic diagnosis on clinical outcomes and health-related quality of life for these infants remains incomplete. We therefore evaluated parent-reported outcomes complemented by clinical outcomes measures over one year for a cohort of infants in the NICU undergoing genetic evaluation.  MethodsProspective cohort study evaluating outcomes after genetics consultation in a level IV NICU via parent-report and electronic medical records (EMR) review. Eligible infants were genetically undiagnosed at enrollment. Parent surveys were administered at baseline and three, six-, and 12-months following enrollment and assessed genetic testing utility as well as parent-reported infant health-related quality of life using the Infant Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire.  Results110 infant-parent pairs were enrolled. Infants had a median age at enrollment of 15 days (interquartile range 8-37.75). At baseline, 74% (81/110) of parents endorsed high importance of finding a genetic diagnosis, but perceived importance significantly decreased over time. Over the study period, 38 infants received a molecular diagnosis per parent report, though this was discordant with EMR review. Identification of a diagnosis did not significantly impact health-related quality of life across most domains, which was lower overall than population norms.  ConclusionsA genetic diagnosis is highly desired by parents in the NICU, though waning interest over time for undiagnosed families may reflect parental emotional adaptation and acceptance. Additional supports are needed to improve perceived quality of life",medrxiv
Limited Clinical Impact of Genetic Associations between Celiac Disease and Type 2 Inflammatory Diseases: Insights from Mendelian Randomization,"Background: Celiac disease, a gluten-triggered autoimmune disorder, is known for its systemic inflammatory effects. Its genetic associations with type 2 inflammatory diseases like asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis remain unclear, prompting this study to explore their potential genetic interplay. Methods: Utilizing two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR), we examined the genetic associations using 15 genetic instruments from GWAS datasets. Our analysis focused on celiac disease and its relation to asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and IgE-mediated food allergies. A power analysis was conducted to determine the study's detection capabilities, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using various MR methods. Results: Our Mendelian randomization analysis identified statistically significant genetic associations between celiac disease and several type 2 inflammatory diseases, although these were practically insignificant. Specifically, celiac disease was associated with a slight increase in the risk of atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.037) and a minor protective effect against asthma (OR = 0.97). The link with allergic rhinitis was statistically detectable (OR = 1.002) but practically negligible. Despite robust statistical confirmation through various sensitivity analyses, all observed effects remained within the range of practical equivalence (ROPE). Conclusions: Our study identifies potential genetic associations between celiac disease and certain type 2 inflammatory diseases. However, these associations, predominantly within the ROPE range, suggest only limited clinical implications. These findings highlight the need for cautious interpretation and indicate that further exploration for clinical applications may not be warranted at this stage",PubMed
Genetic Associations Between Celiac Disease and Type 2 Inflammatory Diseases: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis,"BackgroundCeliac disease, a gluten-triggered autoimmune disorder, is known for its systemic inflammatory effects. Epidemiological data suggest an association with type 2 inflammatory diseases like asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis, however, genetic associations remain unclear, prompting this study to explore their potential genetic interplay.  MethodsUtilizing Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization (TSMR), we examined genetic associations using 15 genetic instruments from GWAS datasets. Our analysis focused on celiac disease and its relation to asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Power analysis was conducted to determine the studys detection capabilities, and Odds Ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using various MR methods.  ResultsA significant positive association was observed between celiac disease and atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.037, 95% CI: 1.015 - 1.059), and a slight association with allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.002, 95% CI: 1.0004 - 1.0032). Conversely, a minor protective effect was noted for asthma (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.96 - 0.98). These results, supported by a high F-statistic, suggest a strong genetic linkage, despite some heterogeneity and complexity in the associations.  ConclusionOur study identifies significant genetic links between celiac disease and type 2 inflammatory diseases, particularly atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis, with a minor protective effect against asthma. These findings, underscored by a strong F-statistic, suggest complex genetic interactions and emphasize the need for further research to explore their clinical relevance",medrxiv
A Metabolic Biomarker Panel for Congenital Heart Disease Assessment with Newborn Dried Blood Spots,"BackgroundCongenital heart disease (CHD) represents a significant contributor to both morbidity and mortality in neonates and children. The prompt recognition of CHD can facilitate timely and appropriate intervention, reducing the probability of complications and enhancing the prognosis for impacted newborns. However, unlike other rare conditions routinely identified through federal and state newborn screening (NBS) programs, theres currently no analogous dried blood spot (DBS) screening for CHD immediately after birth.  ObjectiveThis study was set to identify reliable metabolite biomarkers with clinical relevance, with the aim to assess feasibility of screening and subtype classification of CHD utilizing the DBS newborn screening method.  MethodsWe assembled a cohort of DBS datasets from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Biobank, encompassing both normal controls and three pre-defined CHD categories (tetralogy of Fallot, inherited arrhythmia syndrome, neonatal cardiomyopathy). A robust, DBS-oriented metabolomic method, employing both global and targeted strategies based on liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), was developed. To verify the reliability of this metabolic profiling, we conducted a correlation analysis comparing the absolute quantitated metabolite concentration in DBS against the CDPH NBS records. Additionally, for hydrophilic and hydrophobic metabolites, we executed significant pathway and metabolite analyses respectively. Finally, logistic and LightGBM models were established to aid in CHD discrimination and classification.  ResultsOur metabolomic workflow demonstrated consistent and reliable quantification of metabolites in DBS samples stored at the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) for up to 15 years. Through this process, we discerned dysregulated metabolic pathways in CHD patients, including deviations in lipid and energy metabolism, as well as oxidative stress pathways. Furthermore, we identified three metabolites as potential biomarkers for CHD assessment, and an additional twelve metabolites as potential markers for classifying different CHD subtypes within DBS samples.  ConclusionsThis study represents the first attempt to validate metabolite profiling results using long-term storage DBS samples procured from the high-quality conditions of the CDPH biobank. The results unveil distinct metabolic discrepancies between various CHD subtypes and healthy controls. Furthermore, our findings highlight the potential clinical applications of our DBS-based methods for CHD screening and subtype classification",medrxiv
Evaluating GPT-4-based ChatGPT's Clinical Potential on the NEJM Quiz,"BackgroundGPT-4-based ChatGPT demonstrates significant potential in various industries; however, its potential clinical applications remain largely unexplored.  MethodsWe employed the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) quiz ""Image Challenge"" from October 2021 to March 2023 to assess ChatGPTs clinical capabilities. The quiz, designed for healthcare professionals, tests the ability to analyze clinical scenarios and make appropriate decisions. We evaluated ChatGPTs performance on the NEJM quiz, analyzing its accuracy rate by questioning type and specialty after excluding quizzes which were impossible to answer without images. The NEJM quiz has five multiple-choice options, but ChatGPT was first asked to answer without choices, and then given the choices to answer afterwards, in order to evaluate the accuracy in both scenarios.  ResultsChatGPT achieved an 87% accuracy without choices and a 97% accuracy with choices, after excluding 16 image-based quizzes. Upon analyzing performance by quiz type, ChatGPT excelled in the Diagnosis category, attaining 89% accuracy without choices and 98% with choices. Although other categories featured fewer cases, ChatGPTs performance remained consistent. It demonstrated strong performance across the majority of medical specialties; however, Genetics had the lowest accuracy at 67%.  ConclusionChatGPT demonstrates potential for clinical application, suggesting its usefulness in supporting healthcare professionals and enhancing AI-driven healthcare",medrxiv
"Ex vivo susceptibility to antimalarial drugs and polymorphisms in drug resistance genes of African Plasmodium falciparum, 2016-2023: a genotype-phenotype association study","BackgroundGiven the altered responses to both artemisinins and lumefantrine in Eastern Africa, monitoring antimalarial drug resistance in all African countries is paramount.  MethodsWe measured the susceptibility to six antimalarials using ex vivo growth inhibition assays (IC50) for a total of 805 Plasmodium falciparum isolates obtained from travelers returning to France (2016-2023), mainly from West and Central Africa. Isolates were sequenced using molecular inversion probes (MIPs) targeting fourteen drug resistance genes across the parasite genome.  FindingsEx vivo susceptibility to several drugs has significantly decreased in 2019-2023 versus 2016-2018 parasite samples: lumefantrine (median IC50: 23{middle dot}0 nM [IQR: 14{middle dot}4-35{middle dot}1] in 2019-2023 versus 13{middle dot}9 nM [8{middle dot}42-21{middle dot}7] in 2016-2018, p<0{middle dot}0001), monodesethylamodiaquine (35{middle dot}4 [21{middle dot}2-51{middle dot}1] versus 20{middle dot}3 nM [15{middle dot}4-33{middle dot}1], p<0{middle dot}0001), and marginally piperaquine (20{middle dot}5 [16{middle dot}5-26{middle dot}2] versus 18.0 [14{middle dot}2-22{middle dot}4] nM, p<0{middle dot}0001). Only four isolates carried a validated pfkelch13 mutation. Multiple mutations in pfcrt and one in pfmdr1 (N86Y) were significantly associated with altered susceptibility to multiple drugs. The susceptibility to lumefantrine was altered by pfcrt and pfmdr1 mutations in an additive manner, with the wild-type haplotype (pfcrt K76-pfmdr1 N86) exhibiting the least susceptibility.  InterpretationOur study on P. falciparum isolates from West and Central Africa indicates a low prevalence of molecular markers of artemisinin resistance but a significant decrease in susceptibility to the partner drugs that have been the most widely used since a decade -lumefantrine and amodiaquine. These phenotypic changes likely mark parasite adaptation to sustained drug pressure and call for intensifying the monitoring of antimalarial drug resistance in Africa.  FundingThis work was supported by the French Ministry of Health (grant to the French National Malaria Reference Center) and by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR-17-CE15-0013-03 to JC). JAB was supported by NIH R01AI139520. JR postdoctoral fellowship was funded by Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement.  Research in context Evidence before this studyArtemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have been introduced since the 2000s as the first-line curative treatment of malaria. ACTs combine an artemisinin derivative, which rapidly reduces parasite load, with another antimalarial drug -known as partner drug-which eliminates the remaining parasites thanks to its longer half-life. This approach reduces the likelihood of parasites developing resistance to both drugs, thereby increasing treatment efficacy and delaying the emergence of resistance. However, resistance to artemisinins and then to some partner drugs was identified in Southeast Asia more than a decade ago and has spread throughout the region. Artemisinin partial resistance is now emerging in the East and Horn of Africa. It manifests as delayed parasite clearance from the bloodstream after treatment, increasing the parasite load in contact with the partner drug only and the likelihood of selecting resistant parasites. It is, therefore, important to monitor antimalarial drug susceptibility and drug resistance mutations in contemporary African isolates, especially in the understudied West and Central African regions, to anticipate the spread of multidrug-resistant parasites.  We searched for articles on antimalarial drug resistance published between January 1, 2000, and July 1, 2024, using the PubMed search terms ""antimalarial resistance"", ""Africa"", and ""ex vivo"". Of the 69 published studies, only six encompassing a total of 827 isolates across five West and Central African countries from 2016 to 2022 combined ex vivo drug assays with genotyping data. Parasites with an increased rate of ex vivo survival to artemisinins were reported in one study from Ghana (7/90 isolates in 2018) and another from The Gambia (4/41 isolates in 2017). Only the Ghanaian study reported mutations in the non-propeller domain of pfkelch13 gene, whereas the Gambian study reported mutations associated with reduced susceptibility to lumefantrine (7%, 3/41). In Mali, Senegal and Burkina Faso, most isolates were susceptible to commonly used antimalarial drugs (chloroquine, amodiaquine, piperaquine, mefloquine, lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin) using standard growth inhibition assays. In Ghana, reduced susceptibility to artemisinin, mefloquine and amodiaquine was observed. The relative lack of recent data on parasite susceptibility to antimalarial drugs in recent parasites from West and Central Africa prompted us to conduct this study.  Added value of this studyEx vivo susceptibility to six antimalarial drugs (dihydroartemisinin, lumefantrine, mefloquine, chloroquine, monodesethylamodiaquine, and piperaquine) and mutations in fourteen drug resistance genes were evaluated in 805 isolates collected between January 2016 and February 2023 from 35 African countries, mainly from West and Central Africa.  Median IC50 values were in the low nanomolar range, indicating good potency against P. falciparum. However, worrying trends emerged from 2019 onwards, with median IC50 values for lumefantrine that increased from 13{middle dot}9 nM in 2016-18 to 23 nM in 2019-23 and for amodiaquine from 20{middle dot}3 nM to 35{middle dot}4 nM.  The high prevalence of resistance alleles in pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfmdr1 and pfcrt genes underscores the sustained pressure exerted by antimalarial drugs on parasite populations. Notably, although the triple mutant pfdhfr N51I-C59R-S108N was highly prevalent, the dhfr-dhps quintuple mutant (with extra pfdhps A437G-K540E), which is responsible for sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment failure in adults and children, was rare. In addition, the analysis revealed some geographic and temporal variations in mutation prevalence.  The genotype-phenotype association analysis performed in this study elucidates the relationship between genetic variants and ex vivo drug susceptibility, providing valuable information for understanding the molecular basis of resistance and informing future treatment strategies. For example, mutations in the pfcrt and pfmdr1 genes, mainly K76T and N86Y, were associated with altered susceptibilities to most drugs. Haplotypic association analysis further indicated that the two genes have cumulative effects on the susceptibility to lumefantrine, with the wild-type haplotype (pfcrt K76-pfmdr1 N86) exhibiting the least susceptibility.  Implication of all the available evidenceWhile the susceptibility to most antimalarials suggests continued efficacy, the observed decrease in susceptibilities to lumefantrine and amodiaquine in parasites from West and Central Africa from 2019 onwards suggests an ongoing adaptation of parasites, possibly related to the increasing use of ACT treatments in Sub-saharan Africa since a decade. These phenotypic changes over time were accompanied by small changes in the prevalence of resistance alleles in pfcrt and pfmdr1 genes. Additional changes, potentially leading to larger decreases in drug susceptibilities, can be expected over time. The large-scale analysis presented here provides invaluable, contemporary insights into the current landscape of susceptibility to antimalarial drugs and molecular markers of resistance in P. falciparum isolates from West and Central Africa. While the data suggests that ACTs and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine are likely to be effective in these regions, the phenotypic changes we observed call for intensifying the monitoring of antimalarial drug resistance in Africa",medrxiv
Integrating large scale genetic and clinical information to predict cases of heart failure,"BackgroundHeart failure (HF) is a major cause of death globally. Prediction of HF risk and early initiation of treatment could mitigate disease progression.  ObjectivesThe study aimed to improve the prediction accuracy of HF by integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS)- and electronic health records (EHR)-derived risk scores.  MethodsWe previously performed the largest HF GWAS to date within the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative to create a polygenic risk score (PRS). To extract clinical information from high-dimensional EHR data, we treated diagnosis codes as  words and leveraged natural language processing techniques to create a clinical risk score (ClinRS). Our method first learned code co-occurrence patterns and extracted 350 latent phenotypes (low-dimensional features) representing EHR codes, then used coefficients from regression of HF on the latent phenotypes in a training set as weights to calculate patient ClinRS in a validation set. Model performances were compared between baseline (age and sex) model and models with risk scores added: 1) PRS, 2) ClinRS, and 3) PRS+ClinRS. We further compared the proposed models with Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) heart failure risk score.  ResultsResults showed that PRS and ClinRS were each able to predict HF outcomes significantly better than the baseline model, up to eight years prior to HF diagnosis. By including both PRS and ClinRS in the model, we achieved superior performance in predicting HF up to ten years prior to HF diagnosis, two years earlier than using a single risk predictor alone. Additionally, we found that ClinRS performed significantly better than ARIC model at one year prior to disease diagnosis.  ConclusionsWe demonstrate the additive power of integrating GWAS- and EHR-derived risk scores to predict HF cases prior to diagnosis",medrxiv
ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel: Reappraisal of Genes associated with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy,"BackgroundHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited cardiac condition affecting [~]1 in 500 and exhibits marked genetic heterogeneity. Previously published in 2019, 57 HCM-associated genes were curated providing the first systematic evaluation of gene-disease validity. Here we report work by the ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel (HCVD-GCEP) to reappraise the clinical validity of previously curated and new putative HCM genes.  MethodsThe ClinGen systematic gene curation framework was used to re-classify the gene-disease relationships for HCM and related syndromic entities involving left ventricular hypertrophy. Genes previously curated were included if their classification was not definitive, and if the time since curation was >2-3 years. New genes with literature assertions for HCM were included for initial evaluation. Existing genes were curated for new inheritance patterns where evidence existed. Curations were presented on twice monthly calls, with the HCVD-GCEP composed of 29 individuals from 21 institutions across 6 countries.  ResultsThirty-one genes were re-curated and an additional 5 new potential HCM-associated genes were curated. Among the re-curated genes, 17 (55%) genes changed classification: 1 limited and 4 disputed (from no known disease relationship), 9 disputed (from limited), and 3 definitive (from moderate). Among these, 3 (10%) genes had a clinically relevant upgrade, including TNNC1, a 9th sarcomere gene with definitive HCM association. With new evidence, two genes were curated for multiple inheritance patterns (TRIM63, disputed for autosomal dominant but moderate for autosomal recessive; ALPK3, strong for autosomal dominant and definitive for recessive). CSRP3 was curated for a semi-dominant mode of inheritance (definitive). Nine (29%) genes were downgraded to disputed, further discouraging clinical reporting of variants in these genes. Five genes recently reported to cause HCM were curated: RPS6KB1 and RBM20 (limited), KLHL24 and MT-TI (moderate), and FHOD3 (definitive).  ConclusionsWe report 29 genes with definitive, strong or moderate evidence of causation for HCM or isolated LVH, including sarcomere, sarcomere-associated and syndromic conditions",medrxiv
Post Stroke Motor Recovery Genome-Wide Association Study: A Domain-Specific Approach,"BackgroundIn this genome wide association study (GWAS) we aimed to discover single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with motor recovery post-stroke.  MethodsWe used the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) dataset of 2,100 genotyped patients with non-disabling stroke. Of these, 488 patients had motor impairment at enrollment. Genotyped data underwent strict quality control and imputation. The GWAS utilized logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations (GEE) to leverage the repeated NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) motor score measurements spanning 6 time points over 24 months. The primary outcome was a decrease in the motor drift score of [&ge;] 1 vs. < 1 at each timepoint. Our model estimated the odds ratio of motor improvement for each SNP after adjusting for age, sex, race, days from stroke to visit, initial motor score, VISP treatment arm, and principal components.  ResultsAlthough no associations reached genome-wide significance (p < 5 x 10-8), our analysis detected 115 suggestive associations (p < 5 x 10-6). Notably, we found multiple SNP clusters near genes with plausible neuronal repair biology mechanisms. The CLDN23 gene had the most convincing association which affects blood-brain barrier integrity, neurodevelopment, and immune cell transmigration.  ConclusionWe identified novel suggestive genetic associations with the first ever motor-specific post stroke recovery GWAS. The results seem to describe a distinct stroke recovery phenotype compared to prior genetic stroke outcome studies that use outcome measures, like the mRS. Replication and further mechanistic investigation are warranted. Additionally, this study demonstrated a proof-of-principle approach to optimize statistical efficiency with longitudinal datasets for genetic discovery",medrxiv
ChatGPT- versus human-generated answers to frequently asked questions about diabetes: a Turing test-inspired survey among employees of a Danish diabetes center,"BackgroundLarge language models have received enormous attention recently with some studies demonstrating their potential clinical value, despite not being trained specifically for this domain. We aimed to investigate whether ChatGPT, a language model optimized for dialogue, can answer frequently asked questions about diabetes.  MethodsWe conducted a closed e-survey among employees of a large Danish diabetes center. The study design was inspired by the Turing test and non-inferiority trials. Our survey included ten questions with two answers each. One of these was written by a human expert, while the other was generated by ChatGPT. Participants had the task to identify the ChatGPT-generated answer. Data was analyzed at the question-level using logistic regression with robust variance estimation with clustering at participant level. In secondary analyses, we investigated the effect of participant characteristics on the outcome. A 55% non-inferiority margin was pre-defined based on precision simulations and had been published as part of the study protocol before data collection began.  FindingsAmong 311 invited individuals, 183 participated in the survey (59% response rate). 64% had heard of ChatGPT before, and 19% had tried it. Overall, participants could identify ChatGPT-generated answers 59.5% (95% CI: 57.0, 62.0) of the time. Among participant characteristics, previous ChatGPT use had the strongest association with the outcome (odds ratio: 1.52 (1.16, 2.00), p=0.003). Previous users answered 67.4% (61.7, 72.7) of the questions correctly, versus non-users 57.6% (54.9, 60.3).  InterpretationParticipants could distinguish between ChatGPT-generated and human-written answers somewhat better than flipping a fair coin. However, our results suggest a stronger predictive value of linguistic features rather than the actual content. Rigorously planned studies are needed to elucidate the risks and benefits of integrating such technologies in routine clinical practice.  Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA) was released on 30th of November, 2022. A PubMed search for  ChatGPT conducted on 5th of February, 2023, returned 21 results. All of these were either editorials, commentaries or investigated educational perspectives of the technology. We also searched medRxiv, which returned seven preprints on the topic. Two studies investigated ChatGPT  s performance on the United States Medical Licensing Exam and reported that it passed some components of the exam. Other studies investigated ChatGPT  s ability to answer questions in specific medical specialties, including ophthalmology, genetics, musculoskeletal disorders, with encouraging results, but often expressing the need for further specialization. We identified one study where participants had to distinguish between chatbot- and human-generated answers to patient-healthcare provider interactions extracted from electronic health records. Chatbot-generated responses were identified 65% of the time, suggesting that they were weakly distinguishable from human-generated answers.  Added value of this studyOur study is among the first ones to assess the capabilities of ChatGPT from the patients perspective instead of focusing on retrieval of scientific knowledge. We did so in a rigorously designed study inspired by the Turing test and non-inferiority trials. Among all participants, 64% had heard of ChatGPT before, and 19% had tried it. These proportions were even higher among men (87% and 48%). Overall, participants could identify ChatGPT-generated answers (versus human) 60% of the time. We found that individuals who had previously used ChatGPT could distinguish ChatGPT-generated answers from human answers more often, while having contact with patients was not as strong a discriminator. This may suggest a stronger predictive value of linguistic features rather than the actual content.  Implications of all available evidenceAfter ChatGPT, a general-purpose large language model optimized for dialogue, demonstrated its capabilities to the general public, an enormous interest arose in how large language models can support medical research and clinical tasks. Despite not being specifically trained for this, ChatGPT not only has clinical knowledge, but also encodes information about disease management and practical aspects relevant to patients everyday lives. Large language models optimized for healthcare use are warranted, but rigorously planned studies are needed to elucidate the risks and benefits of integrating such technologies in patient care",medrxiv
Evaluating genetically-predicted causal effects of lipoprotein(a) in human diseases: a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization study,"BackgroundLipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is a circulating plasma lipoprotein that is emerging as an important independent risk factor for vascular disease. Lp(a) levels are 75-90% heritable, predominantly determined by copy number variation and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the LPA gene.  MethodsUsing [~]370K individuals with serum measurements of Lp(a) in the UK Biobank European cohort, we constructed a genetic risk score (GRS) consisting of 29 SNPs in the vicinity of LPA which explained 68.18% of variation in Lp(a). Using the LPA GRS to instrument Lp(a), we conducted phenome-wide Mendelian randomization analysis (MR-PheWAS) across a spectrum of 489 medically-relevant phenotypes in [~]7.3M individuals from the 23andMe, Inc. database, and compared effects to those derived from a GRS for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB). Through multivariable MR, we sought to assess the direct causal effect of Lp(a) on cardiovascular disease risks while keeping LDL-C or apoB constant.  ResultsMR-PheWAS confirmed previously reported Lp(a) causal effects on coronary artery disease (CAD: OR = 1.199, 95% CI = [1.193, 1.205], p-value < 2.23x10-308, for every 59.632 nmol/L higher Lp(a) instrumented by the LPA GRS), and revealed additional genetically-predicted effects largely confined to cardiovascular endpoints, including a novel effect for restrictive cardiomyopathy (OR = 1.101, 95% CI = [1.068, 1.134], p-value = 3x10-10). We scaled the LPA, LDL-C and apoB GRS such that they each had the same OR for MACE (major adverse cardiovascular events). Using the scaling rubric, similar magnitudes of effect were seen for the three lipid traits for most vascular diseases, with the exception of peripheral artery disease, aortic stenosis and dilated cardiomyopathy, where Lp(a) had larger genetically-predicted effect sizes compared to LDL-C and apoB. Multivariable MR identified Lp(a) to retain a causal effect on MACE while accounting for LDL-C or apoB. To achieve the 25% relative risk reduction in major vascular events, as seen with a 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C from statin trials, we anticipate that Lp(a) ought to be reduced by [~] 90 mg/dL (200 nmol/L), highlighting the importance of not only using therapies that have a profound impact on Lp(a) lowering, but also selecting individuals that have high Lp(a) concentrations at baseline.  ConclusionLp(a) has genetically-predicted causal effects on a broad range of cardiovascular diseases beyond CAD, with minimal effects seen for non-vascular disease",medrxiv
Epistatic Features and Machine Learning Improve Alzheimer's Risk Prediction Over Polygenic Risk Scores,"BackgroundPolygenic risk scores (PRS) are linear combinations of genetic markers weighted by effect size that are commonly used to predict disease risk. For complex heritable diseases such as late onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD), PRS models fail to capture much of the heritability. Additionally, PRS models are highly dependent on the population structure of data on which effect sizes are assessed, and have poor generalizability to new data.  ObjectiveThe goal of this study is to construct a paragenic risk score that, in addition to single genetic marker data used in PRS, incorporates epistatic interaction features and machine learning methods to predict lifetime risk for LOAD.  MethodsWe construct a new state-of-the-art genetic model for lifetime risk of Alzheimers disease. Our approach innovates over PRS models in two ways: First, by directly incorporating epistatic interactions between SNP loci using an evolutionary algorithm guided by shared pathway information; and second, by estimating risk via an ensemble of machine learning models (gradient boosting machines and deep learning) instead of simple logistic regression. We compare the paragenic model to a PRS model from the literature trained on the same dataset.  ResultsThe paragenic model is significantly more accurate than the PRS model under 10-fold cross-validation, obtaining an AUC of 83% and near-clinically significant matched sensitivity/specificity of 75%, and remains significantly more accurate when evaluated on an independent holdout dataset. Additionally, the paragenic model maintains accuracy within APOE genotypes.  ConclusionParagenic models show potential for improving lifetime disease risk prediction for complex heritable diseases such as LOAD over PRS models",medrxiv
Proteomic Networks and Related Genetic Variants Associated with Smoking and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"BackgroundStudies have identified individual blood biomarkers associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and related phenotypes. However, complex diseases such as COPD typically involve changes in multiple molecules with interconnections that may not be captured when considering single molecular features.  MethodsLeveraging proteomic data from 3,173 COPDGene Non-Hispanic White (NHW) and African American (AA) participants, we applied sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet) to 4,776 proteins assayed on the SomaScan v4.0 platform to derive sparse networks of proteins associated with current vs. former smoking status, airflow obstruction, and emphysema quantitated from high-resolution computed tomography scans. We then used NetSHy, a dimension reduction technique leveraging network topology, to produce summary scores of each proteomic network, referred to as NetSHy scores. We next performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify variants associated with the NetSHy scores, or network quantitative trait loci (nQTLs). Finally, we evaluated the replicability of the networks in an independent cohort, SPIROMICS.  ResultsWe identified networks of 13 to 104 proteins for each phenotype and exposure in NHW and AA, and the derived NetSHy scores significantly associated with the variable of interests. Networks included known (sRAGE, ALPP, MIP1) and novel molecules (CA10, CPB1, HIS3, PXDN) and interactions involved in COPD pathogenesis. We observed 7 nQTL loci associated with NetSHy scores, 4 of which remained after conditional analysis. Networks for smoking status and emphysema, but not airflow obstruction, demonstrated a high degree of replicability across race groups and cohorts.  ConclusionsIn this work, we apply state-of-the-art molecular network generation and summarization approaches to proteomic data from COPDGene participants to uncover protein networks associated with COPD phenotypes. We further identify genetic associations with networks. This work discovers protein networks containing known and novel proteins and protein interactions associated with clinically relevant COPD phenotypes across race groups and cohorts",medrxiv
The impact of damaging epilepsy and cardiac genetic variant burden in sudden death in the young,"BackgroundSudden unexpected death in children is a tragic event. Understanding the genetics of sudden death in the young (SDY) enables family counseling and cascade screening. The objective of this study was to characterize genetic variation in an SDY cohort using whole genome sequencing.  MethodsThe SDY Case Registry is a National Institutes of Health/Centers for Disease Control surveillance effort to discern the prevalence, causes, and risk factors for SDY. The SDY Case Registry prospectively collected clinical data and DNA biospecimens from SDY cases <20 years of age. SDY cases were collected from medical examiner and coroner offices spanning 13 US jurisdictions from 2015-2019. The cohort included 211 children (mean age 1 year; range 0-20 years), determined to have died suddenly and unexpectedly and in whom DNA biospecimens and next-of-kin consent were ascertained. A control cohort consisted of 211 randomly sampled, sex-and ancestry-matched individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. Genetic variation was evaluated in epilepsy, cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia genes in the SDY and control cohorts. American College of Medical Genetics/Genomics guidelines were used to classify variants as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Additionally, genetic variation predicted to be damaging was identified using a Bayesian-based artificial intelligence (AI) tool.  ResultsThe SDY cohort was 42% European, 30% African, 17% Hispanic, and 11% with mixed ancestries, and 39% female. Six percent of the cohort was found to harbor a pathogenic or likely pathogenic genetic variant in an epilepsy, cardiomyopathy or arrhythmia gene. The genomes of SDY cases, but not controls, were enriched for rare, damaging variants in epilepsy, cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia-related genes. A greater number of rare epilepsy genetic variants correlated with younger age at death.  ConclusionsWhile damaging cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia genes are recognized contributors to SDY, we also observed an enrichment in epilepsy-related genes in the SDY cohort, and a correlation between rare epilepsy variation and younger age at death. These findings emphasize the importance of considering epilepsy genes when evaluating SDY",medrxiv
"Genetic evidence for efficacy of targeting IL-2, IL-6, and TYK2 signaling in prevention of type 1 diabetes: A Mendelian randomization study","BackgroundType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, which leads to insulin dependence. We investigated genetic evidence to support the repurposing of seven drugs, already licensed or in clinical phases of development, for prevention of type 1 diabetes.  MethodsWe obtained genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for the risk of type 1 diabetes, whole-blood gene expression, and serum protein levels, and investigated genetic polymorphisms near seven potential drug target genes. We used colocalization to examine whether the same genetic variants that are associated with type 1 diabetes risk were also associated with the relevant drug target genetic proxies, and Mendelian randomization to evaluate the direction and magnitude of the associations. Furthermore, we performed Mendelian randomization analysis restricted to functional variants within the drug target genes.  FindingsColocalization revealed that the blood interleukin (IL)-2 receptor subunit alpha (IL2RA) and IL-6 receptor (IL6R) gene expression levels within the corresponding genes shared the same causal variant with type 1 diabetes liability (posterior probabilities 100% and 96.3%, respectively). Odds ratios (OR) of type 1 diabetes per 1-SD increase in the genetically proxied gene expression of IL2RA and IL6R were 0.22 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.27) and 1.98 (95% CI 1.48-2.65), respectively. Using missense variants, genetically proxied tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) expression levels were associated with type 1 diabetes risk (OR 0.61, 95% CI [0.54-0.70]).  InterpretationOur findings support the targeting of IL-2, IL-6R and TYK2 signaling in prevention of type 1 diabetes. Further studies should assess the optimal window to intervene to prevent type 1 diabetes.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for GWAS, Mendelian randomization, colocalization, and other studies for genetic evidence of efficacy of targeting IL2RA, IL2RB, IL6R, IL6ST, IL23A, TYK2, JAK2, and JAK3 signaling in prevention of type 1 diabetes. We searched studies with combinations of ""IL2RA"", ""IL2RB"", ""IL6R"", ""IL6ST"", ""IL23A"", ""JAK2"", ""JAK3"", ""TYK2"", ""colocalization"", ""mendelian randomization"", or ""GWAS"" and ""Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1""[Mesh].  A recent large GWAS by Robertson et al. observed five conditionally independent genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of type 1 diabetes in intergenic and intronic areas near IL2RA. Another large recent GWAS by Chiou et al. found six independent SNPs associated with the risk of type 1 diabetes near IL2RA. A few smaller candidate gene studies also reported associations between the risk of type 1 diabetes and eight other loci near IL2RA. Epigenetic studies reported that a few type 1 diabetes risk variants near IL2RA are associated with changes in methylation of DNA near promoters of IL2RA in white blood cells and B-cells.  Both above mentioned GWAS found associations between two missense mutations in TYK2 gene (rs12720356(A>C), rs34536443(G>C)) and the risk of type 1 diabetes. The same variants protected against type 1 diabetes and some other autoimmune diseases in a Finnish FINNGEN biobank study. Smaller candidate gene studies found that the rs2304256 A/A genotype was protective against type 1 diabetes in a Southern Brazilian and in a European population. In a study of Japanese population, similar association was not seen, possibly due to differences in allele frequencies and incidence of type 1 diabetes between populations. In the same study, TYK2 promoter haplotype with genetic polymorphisms in promoter region and exon 1 decreased the promoter activity and increased the risk for type 1 diabetes. The minor 358Ala allele of the IL6R SNP rs2228145 (A>C) was found to be associated with a reduced risk of developing T1D.  In addition to loci near or at IL2RA and TYK2 loci, the GWAS by Robertson et al. reported an association between rs2229238 near IL6R and the risk of type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, a candidate gene study found that the GG haplotypes of variants rs11171806 and rs2066808 (in strong LD) near IL23A was protective against T1D.  We found no studies in which colocalization between the loci near the reviewed genes and type 1 diabetes was reported nor estimates from Mendelian randomization on the possible causal relationship. However, Robertson et al. studied the genetic evidence for therapeutic potential of their GWAS hits using a priority index algorithm, which combined information from GWAS of type 1 diabetes, expression quantitative loci in immune cells, evidence from chromatin conformation in immune cells, as well as protein-protein interactions and genomic annotations. Among the reported GWAS hits, priority index ranked IL2RA as the top target, followed by TYK2 (the 3rd target), JAK2 (11th), IL23 (25th), JAK3 (35th), and IL6R (50th).  Added value of this studyWe found that the risk of type 1 diabetes and whole-blood gene expression of IL2RA and IL6R colocalized to rs61839660 near IL2RA and rs10908839 near IL6R, respectively. Using these loci as instruments of IL2RA and IL6R expression, Mendelian randomization indicated that whole blood IL2RA expression is associated with decreased risk of type 1 diabetes (OR 0.70 per 1 SD increase) whereas IL6R expression is associated with increased risk (OR 1.079 per 1 SD increase). Furthermore, when a missense variant rs2304256 in TYK2 was used as an instrument for TYK2 expression, Mendelian randomization indicated that an SD increase in TYK2 expression was predicted to decrease the risk of type 1 diabetes (OR 0.61).  Implications of all the available evidenceWe found genetic evidence supporting the efficacy of targeting IL-2, IL-6 and TYK2 signalling in prevention of type 1 diabetes. Further research is needed to address when would be the most optimal time to intervene in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes",medrxiv
Cytosolic bacterial pathogens activate TLR pathways in tumors that synergistically enhance STING agonist cancer therapies,"Bacterial pathogens that invade the eukaryotic cytosol are distinctive tools for fighting cancer, as they preferentially target tumors and can deliver cancer antigens to MHC-I. Cytosolic bacterial pathogens have undergone extensive preclinical development and human clinical trials, yet the molecular mechanisms by which they are detected by innate immunity in tumors is unclear. We report that intratumoral delivery of phylogenetically distinct cytosolic pathogens, including Listeria, Rickettsia, and Burkholderia species, elicited anti-tumor responses in established, poorly immunogenic melanoma and lymphoma in mice. We were surprised to observe that although the bacteria required entry to the cytosol, the anti-tumor responses were largely independent of the cytosolic sensors cGAS/STING and instead required TLR signaling. Combining pathogens with TLR agonists did not enhance anti-tumor efficacy, while combinations with STING agonists elicited profound, synergistic anti-tumor effects with complete responses in >80% of mice after a single dose. Small molecule TLR agonists also synergistically enhanced the anti-tumor activity of STING agonists. The anti-tumor effects were diminished in Rag2-deficient mice and upon CD8 T cell depletion. Mice cured from combination therapy developed immunity to cancer rechallenge that was superior to STING agonist monotherapy. Together, these data provide a framework for enhancing the efficacy of microbial cancer therapies and small molecule innate immune agonists, via the co-activation of STING and TLRs",biorxiv
Sord deficient rats develop a motor-predominant peripheral neuropathy unveiling novel pathophysiological insights,"Biallelic SORD mutations cause one of the most frequent forms of recessive hereditary neuropathy, estimated to affect approximately 10,000 patients in North America and Europe alone. Pathogenic SORD loss-of-function changes in the encoded enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase result in abnormally high sorbitol levels in cells and serum. How sorbitol accumulation leads to peripheral neuropathy remains to be elucidated. A reproducible animal model for SORD neuropathy is essential to illuminate the pathogenesis of SORD deficiency and for preclinical studies of potential therapies. Therefore, we have generated a Sord knockout (KO), Sord-/-, Sprague Dawley rat, to model the human disease and to investigate the pathophysiology underlying SORD deficiency. We have characterized the phenotype in these rats with a battery of behavioral tests as well as biochemical, physiological, and comprehensive histological examinations. Sord-/- rats had remarkably increased levels of sorbitol in serum, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), and peripheral nerve. Moreover, serum from Sord-/- rats contained significantly increased levels of neurofilament light chain, NfL, an established biomarker for axonal degeneration. Motor performance significantly declined in Sord-/- animals starting at [~]7 months of age. Gait analysis evaluated with video motion tracking confirmed abnormal gait patterns in the hindlimbs. Motor nerve conduction velocities of the tibial nerves were slowed. Light and electron microscopy of the peripheral nervous system revealed degenerating myelinated axons, de- and remyelinated axons, and a likely pathognomonic finding - enlarged ""ballooned"" myelin sheaths. These findings mainly affected myelinated motor axons; myelinated sensory axons were largely spared. In summary, Sord-/- rats develop a motor-predominant neuropathy that closely resembles the human phenotype. Our studies revealed novel significant aspects of SORD deficiency, and this model will lead to an improved understanding of the pathophysiology and the therapeutic options for SORD neuropathy",biorxiv
Long-read sequencing improves the genetic diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa by identifying an Alu retrotransposon insertion in the EYS gene,"Biallelic variants in EYS are the major cause of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) in certain populations, a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease that may lead to legal blindness. EYS is one of the largest genes (~ 2 Mb) expressed in the retina, in which structural variants (SVs) represent a common cause of disease. However, their identification using short-read sequencing (SRS) is not always feasible. Here, we conducted targeted long-read sequencing (T-LRS) using adaptive sampling of EYS on the MinION sequencing platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) to definitively diagnose an arRP family, whose affected individuals (n = 3) carried the heterozygous pathogenic deletion of exons 32-33 in the EYS gene. As this was a recurrent variant identified in three additional families in our cohort, we also aimed to characterize the known deletion at the nucleotide level to assess a possible founder effect. T-LRS in family A unveiled a heterozygous AluYa5 insertion in the coding exon 43 of EYS (chr6(GRCh37):g.64430524_64430525ins352), which segregated with the disease in compound heterozygosity with the previously identified deletion. Visual inspection of previous SRS alignments using IGV revealed several reads containing soft-clipped bases, accompanied by a slight drop in coverage at the Alu insertion site. This prompted us to develop a simplified program using grep command to investigate the recurrence of this variant in our cohort from SRS data. Moreover, LRS also allowed the characterization of the CNV as a ~ 56.4kb deletion spanning exons 32-33 of EYS (chr6(GRCh37):g.64764235_64820592del). The results of further characterization by Sanger sequencing and linkage analysis in the four families were consistent with a founder variant. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a mobile element insertion into the coding sequence of EYS, as a likely cause of arRP in a family. Our study highlights the value of LRS technology in characterizing and identifying hidden pathogenic SVs, such as retrotransposon insertions, whose contribution to the etiopathogenesis of rare diseases may be underestimated",PubMed
Ribosomal DNA copy number is associated with body mass in humans and other mammals,"Body mass results from a complex interplay between genetics and environment. The contribution of genetic variation to body mass has been extensively studied, but due to the technical limitations of platforms used for population scale studies, repetitive parts of the genome have not previously been considered. Here we applied genome-wide approaches to identify an association between adult body mass and the copy number (CN) of 45S-ribosomal DNA (rDNA). rDNA codes for the rRNA components of the ribosome and exists in hundreds of copies/cell in mammals. Inter-individual variation in rDNA CN has not previously been documented but has not been associated with a mammalian phenotype. Here, we show that germ-line inherited rDNA CN is associated with post-pubertal growth rate in rats and BMI in adult humans. rDNA CN variation is not associated with rRNA transcription rates in adult tissues, suggesting the mechanistic link occurs earlier in development. This is supported by our observation that it is growth rate and body mass, rather than obesity that are associated with copy number and that these phenotypes emerge prior to adulthood. We present hypotheses for future investigation into the mechanistic basis of this association",biorxiv
"Successful bone marrow transplantation in a patient with Omenn syndrome, a rare variant of severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome: A case report","Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) saves lives in Omenn syndrome, a severe immunodeficiency disorder. Timely genetic diagnosis and matched donor BMT are crucial. Emphasis on newborn screening and multidisciplinary care improves outcomes for infants with inherited disorders. Prompt intervention and comprehensive management are vital for a successful transplant outcome. Omenn syndrome represents a severe variant of combined immunodeficiency characterized by disregulated immune responses and susceptibility to recurrent infections. We present the case of a 3-month-old female infant initially presenting with upper respiratory infection symptoms and a diffuse rash, unresponsive to local treatment. At 4 months of age, the patient underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) utilizing stem cells from a fully matched sibling donor. Pre-transplant conditioning included antimicrobial prophylaxis and supportive therapies. Following BMT, the patient received immunosuppressive medications to prevent graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease. Clinical monitoring post-transplant showed timely neutrophil and platelet engraftment, with subsequent follow-up demonstrating stable clinical parameters and negative cytomegalovirus status. The case highlights the importance of timely diagnosis and treatment in managing severe immunodeficiency disorders, demonstrating the potential for successful outcomes with appropriate timely interventions. Regular monitoring and follow-up appointments were crucial in ensuring the success of the treatment. This case also emphasizes the significance of multidisciplinary care and genetic testing in identifying and managing rare immunodeficiency disorders. The successful outcome in this case provides hope for improved treatment options and better patient outcomes in the future",PubMed
Mind the gap: the relevance of the genome reference to resolve rare and pathogenic inversions,"Both long-read genome sequencing (lrGS) and the recently published Telomere to Telomere (T2T) reference genome provide increased coverage and resolution across repetitive regions promising heightened structural variant detection and improved mapping. Inversions (INV), intrachromosomal segments which are rotated 180° and inserted back into the same chromosome, are a class of structural variants particularly challenging to detect due to their copy-number neutral state and association with repetitive regions. Inversions represent about 1/20 of all balanced structural chromosome aberrations and can lead to disease by gene disruption or altering regulatory regions of dosage sensitive genes in cis . Here we remapped the genome data from six individuals carrying unsolved cytogenetically detected inversions. An INV6 and INV10 were resolved using GRCh38 and T2T-CHM13. Finally, an INV9 required optical genome mapping, de novo assembly of lrGS data and T2T-CHM13. This inversion disrupted intron 25 of EHMT1, confirming a diagnosis of Kleefstra syndrome 1 (MIM#610253). These three inversions, only mappable in specific references, prompted us to investigate the presence and population frequencies of differential reference regions (DRRs) between T2T-CHM13, GRCh37, GRCh38, the chimpanzee and bonobo, and hundreds of megabases of DRRs were identified. Our results emphasize the significance of the chosen reference genome and the added benefits of lrGS and optical genome mapping in solving rearrangements in challenging regions of the genome. This is particularly important for inversions and may impact clinical diagnostics

Recognition of Necrosis and Ethylene-inducing like peptides confers disease resistance in Brassica napus and is modulated by BSK1 in Arabidopsis,"Brassicas are important crops susceptible to significant losses caused by disease: thus, breeding resistant lines can mitigate the effects of pathogens. MAMPs (microbe-associated molecular patterns) are conserved molecules of pathogens that elicit host defence responses known as pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Necrosis & Ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like proteins (NLPs) are MAMPs found in a wide range of phytopathogens, including major disease-causing fungal species. We studied the response to the BcNEP2 from Botrytis cinerea as a representative NLP in Brassica napus to improve our understanding of recognition mechanisms that could enable the development of disease-resistant crops.  To genetically map regions responsible for NLP recognition, we used an associative transcriptomics (AT) approach using diverse B. napus accessions and bulk segregant analysis (BSA) on DNA pools created from a bi-parental cross of NLP-responsive (Ningyou1) and non-responsive (Ningyou7) lines. In silico mapping with AT identified two peaks associated with NLP recognition on chromosomes A04 and C05 whereas the BSA narrowed it down to a main peak on A04. BSA delimited the region associated with NLP-responsiveness to 3 Mbp, containing [~]245 genes on the Darmor-bzh reference genome. Variants detected in the region were used for KASP marker design and four KASP markers were identified co-segregating with the phenotype. The same pipeline was performed with the ZS11 genome, and the highest associated region was confirmed on chromosome A04. Comparative BLAST analysis revealed there were unannotated clusters of RLP homologs on ZS11 chromosome A04. To reduce the number of candidate genes responsible for NLP recognition, RNA-Seq data was used to detect the unannotated expressed putative genes. Screening the BSA Ning1x7 population demonstrated a highly significant association between NLP-recognition and resistance to Botrytis cinerea. Also, the lines non-responsive to NLP had significantly greater response to the bacterial MAMP flg22. Additionally, BnaA01g02190D, a homologue of Arabidopsis AtBSK1 (At4g35230) BR-SIGNALLING KINASE1, was associated with a high BcNEP2-induced ROS response phenotype. We show that in Arabidopsis, Atbsk1 mutants had significantly lower response to BcNEP2 and increased susceptibility to B. cinerea (p-value=1.12e-14***). Overall, the results define the genomic location for NLP-recognition on the B. napus genome and demonstrate that NLP recognition has a positive contribution to disease resistance which can have practical application in crop improvement",biorxiv

The main clinical signs are exercise-induced stiffness and delayed muscular relaxation after physical exercises, even mild ones. No mouse model nor specific therapies exist for Brody myopathy, which is therefore considered an orphan disease. Bovine congenital pseudomyotonia (PMT) is a muscular disorder characterized by an impairment of muscle relaxation and is the only mammalian model of human BD. The pathogenetic mechanism underlying bovine PMT has been recently clarified. These findings prompted us to purpose a potential pharmacological approach addressing a specific population of BD patients who exhibit reduced expression but still exhibit activity of the SERCA1 pump. Preclinical research involving in vivo studies is essential and necessary before clinical trials can be pursued and SERCA protein shows a high degree of conservation among species. So far, the only animal models available to study BD in vivo are a group of zebrafish mutant lines known as accordion zebrafish (acc). In this paper, we focused on a comprehensive characterization of the ""acctq206"" zebrafish variant. Our aim was to use this mutant line as an experimental animal model for testing the novel therapeutic approach for BD",PubMed
Cardiac Xenotransplantation: A Narrative Review,"Cardiac xenotransplantation (cXT) has emerged as a solution to heart donor scarcity, prompting an exploration of its scientific, ethical, and regulatory facets. The review begins with genetic modifications enhancing pig hearts for human transplantation, navigating through immunological challenges, rejection mechanisms, and immune responses. Key areas include preclinical milestones, complement cascade roles, and genetic engineering to address hyperacute rejection. Physiological counterbalance systems, like human thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor upregulation in porcine xenografts, highlight efforts for graft survival enhancement. Evaluating pig and baboon donors and challenges with non-human primates illuminates complexities in donor species selection. Ethical considerations, encompassing animal rights, welfare, and zoonotic disease risks, are critically examined in the cXT context. The review delves into immune control mechanisms with aggressive immunosuppression and clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology, elucidating hyperacute rejection, complement activation, and antibody-mediated rejection intricacies. CRISPR/Cas9's role in creating pig endothelial cells expressing human inhibitor molecules is explored for rejection mitigation. Ethical and regulatory aspects emphasize the role of committees and international guidelines. A forward-looking perspective envisions precision medical genetics, artificial intelligence, and individualized heart cultivation within pigs as transformative elements in cXT's future is also explored. This comprehensive analysis offers insights for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, addressing the current state, and future prospects of cXT",PubMed
Causality of genetically proxied immunophenotypes on cardiovascular diseases: a Mendelian randomization study,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) stand as the foremost global cause of mortality, prompting a growing interest in using the potential of immune cells for heart injury treatment. This study aims to assess the causal association between immune cells and CVDs. A total of 731 immune cells were derived from a previously published genome-wide association study (GWAS), which included approximately 22 million genetic variants among 3,757 individuals of Sardinian ancestry. Genetic associations with atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction and stroke were extracted from large-scale GWAS. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to assess the causal association between immune cells and CVDs. Replication MR analysis based on FinnGen dataset and meta-analysis are sequentially conducted to validate causal relationships. Collectively, genetically predicted 4 immune cell traits were associated with AF and 5 immune cell traits were associated with stroke. Increased levels of IgD- CD38dim absolute count were associated with a higher susceptibility to AF, while increased expression of CD14+ CD16+ monocytes, CD62L on CD62L+ myeloid dendritic cells, and CD16 on CD14- CD16+ monocytes were linked to a decreased susceptibility to AF. Additionally, an elevated susceptibility to stroke was linked to an increase in the percentage of CD39+ resting Tregs and heightened CD27 expression on IgD- CD38+ cells. Conversely, a decreased susceptibility to stroke was associated with increased CD40 expression on monocytes, particularly on CD14+ CD16+ and CD14+ CD16- monocytes, with the latter two showing the most compelling evidence. This study identified several immune cell traits that have a causal relationship with CVDs, thus confirming that immune cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of these diseases",PubMed
Silver chimaera genome assembly and identification of the holocephalan sex chromosome sequence,"Cartilaginous fishes are divided into holocephalans and elasmobranchs, and comparative studies involving them are expected to elucidate how variable phenotypes and distinctive genomic properties were established in those ancient vertebrate lineages. To date, molecular-level studies on holocephalans have concentrated on the family Callorhinchidae, with a chromosome-scale genome assembly of Callorhinchus milii available. In this study, we focused on the most species-rich holocephalan family Chimaeridae and sequenced the genome of its member, silver chimaera (Chimaera phantasma). We report the first chromosome-scale genome assembly of the Chimaeridae, with high continuity and completeness, which exhibited a large intragenomic variation of chromosome lengths, which is correlated with intron size. This pattern is observed more widely in vertebrates and at least partly accounts for cross-species genome size variation. A male-female comparison identified a silver chimaera genomic scaffold with a double sequence depth for females, which we identify as an X chromosome fragment. This is the first DNA sequence-based evidence of a holocephalan sex chromosome, suggesting a male heterogametic sex determination system. This study, allowing the first chromosome-level comparison among holocephalan genomes, will trigger in-depth understanding of the genomic diversity among vertebrates as well as species population genetic structures based on the genome assembly of high completeness",biorxiv
Unveiling the Link Between Celiac Disease and Premature Graying of Hair: A Case Report and Discussion on the Potential Implications for Diagnosis and Management,"Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically predisposed individuals and characterized by diverse clinical presentations. Despite its prevalence, CD often remains undiagnosed due to its heterogeneous symptoms and inadequate awareness. Here, we present a case of a 42-year-old male with gastritis who presented with epigastric discomfort and pancytopenia. Initial investigations revealed a hemoglobin level of 3.7 g/dL, a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 84 fL, a white blood cell count (WBC) of 2420 cells/μL, a neutrophil count (NEU) of 1400 cells/μL, and a platelet count (PLT) of 140,000 cells/μL. A diagnostic workup revealed evidence of CD, and after that, the diagnosis was confirmed by gastro-colonoscopy. The patient's subsequent adherence to a gluten-free diet resulted in significant clinical improvement. Notably, during follow-up appointments, a notable change in the patient's hair color was observed, prompting further inquiry. The patient reported experiencing premature graying of hair during his late thirties, which remained unchanged until the diagnosis of CD and the initiation of a gluten-free diet. This unique manifestation highlights the potential association between CD and premature graying of the hair, warranting further investigation. While the precise mechanism remains unclear, it is plausible that CD-induced malabsorption and nutritional deficiencies may contribute to such changes. Therefore, we advocate for increased awareness and international collaboration to enhance understanding of this phenomenon and its implications for CD management. This case underscores the importance of early diagnosis and management of CD, as well as the potential for dietary interventions to alleviate associated symptoms and complications",PubMed
Chimeric Cell Therapies as a Novel Approach for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Muscle Regeneration,"Chimerism-based strategies represent a pioneering concept which has led to groundbreaking advancements in regenerative medicine and transplantation. This new approach offers therapeutic potential for the treatment of various diseases, including inherited disorders. The ongoing studies on chimeric cells prompted the development of Dystrophin-Expressing Chimeric (DEC) cells which were introduced as a potential therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). DMD is a genetic condition that leads to premature death in adolescent boys and remains incurable with current methods. DEC therapy, created via the fusion of human myoblasts derived from normal and DMD-affected donors, has proven to be safe and efficacious when tested in experimental models of DMD after systemic-intraosseous administration. These studies confirmed increased dystrophin expression, which correlated with functional and morphological improvements in DMD-affected muscles, including cardiac, respiratory, and skeletal muscles. Furthermore, the application of DEC therapy in a clinical study confirmed its long-term safety and efficacy in DMD patients. This review summarizes the development of chimeric cell technology tested in preclinical models and clinical studies, highlighting the potential of DEC therapy in muscle regeneration and repair, and introduces chimeric cell-based therapies as a promising, novel approach for muscle regeneration and the treatment of DMD and other neuromuscular disorders",PubMed
DNA methylation shows footprints of altitude selection in the clonal plant species Fragaria vesca,"Climate change poses a significant threat to plant species, potentially pushing them beyond their adaptive capacities. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, have emerged as a key candidate mechanism enabling plants to quickly adapt to environmental changes by generating locally adapted phenotypes. These phenotypic changes can be even inherited across multiple generations, thus potentially becoming targets of natural selection. However, whether natural selection can act on these epialleles has hardly been tested directly. Addressing this knowledge gap is crucial as population survival may heavily rely on DNA methylation, especially in scenarios with restricted genetic diversity, such as within clonal plant populations.  Here, we employed population genomics approaches on seven natural populations of the clonal species wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca) distributed across an altitudinal range to investigate the presence of epigenetic sites under altitude-driven selection. Our genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic analyses found a wide intra- and inter-population epigenetic diversity despite a considerably low genetic diversity. We identified heritable epialleles exhibiting signs of positive selection related to altitude, i.e. reduced intrapopulation epigenetic diversity and increased epigenetic divergence between low and high altitude. These altitude-selected epigenetic loci overlapped with genes involved in biological processes such as DNA repair, molecular recognition, regulation of gene expression, and chromatin structure. Interestingly, some of these epialleles were independent of genetic variation, suggesting they may have arisen stochastically or in response to environmental variation.  These findings suggest that heritable epigenetic variation could help clonal species quickly adapt to environmental challenges as those related to varying altitudes and/or temperatures.  Significance statementThe eventuality of epigenetic marks being inherited has led the scientific community to rethink evolution and adaptation, debating whether epigenetic information could be considered as the ""fifth base"". However, direct evidence supporting that epigenetic marks are under evolutionary processes such as natural selection remain scarce. To address this knowledge gap, we screened natural populations of wild strawberries and searched for footprints of altitudinal selection on epi-alleles. We found loci matching the criteria for epigenetic selection, i.e. reduced epigenetic diversity in populations, increased epigenetic divergence between populations of different altitudes and transmission to the (clonal) progeny. Some of these selected epi-alleles were not associated with any genetic variant, suggesting that epigenetic marks are another layer of substrate for selection to act",biorxiv
The Nucleotide Transformer: Building and Evaluating Robust Foundation Models for Human Genomics,"Closing the gap between measurable genetic information and observable traits is a longstand-ing challenge in genomics. Yet, the prediction of molecular phenotypes from DNA sequences alone remains limited and inaccurate, often driven by the scarcity of annotated data and the inability to transfer learnings between prediction tasks. Here, we present an extensive study of foundation models pre-trained on DNA sequences, named the Nucleotide Transformer, rang-ing from 50M up to 2.5B parameters and integrating information from 3,202 diverse human genomes, as well as 850 genomes selected across diverse phyla, including both model and non-model organisms. These transformer models yield transferable, context-specific representations of nucleotide sequences, which allow for accurate molecular phenotype prediction even in low-data settings. We show that the developed models can be fine-tuned at low cost and despite low available data regime to solve a variety of genomics applications. Despite no supervision, the transformer models learned to focus attention on key genomic elements, including those that regulate gene expression, such as enhancers. Lastly, we demonstrate that utilizing model rep-resentations can improve the prioritization of functional genetic variants. The training and ap-plication of foundational models in genomics explored in this study provide a widely applicable stepping stone to bridge the gap of accurate molecular phenotype prediction from DNA sequence. Code and weights available at: https://github.com/instadeepai/nucleotide-transformer in Jax and https://huggingface.co/InstaDeepAI in Pytorch.

Pathogenic PHIP Variants are Variably Associated With CAKUT,"Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) represent the most common cause of chronic kidney disease in children. Although only 20% of cases can be genetically explained, the majority remain without an identified underlying etiology. The neurodevelopmental disorder Chung-Jansen syndrome (CHUJANS) is caused by haploinsufficiency of Pleckstrin homology domain-interacting protein (PHIP) and was previously associated with genital malformations. Anecdotal coincidence of CHUJANS and CAKUT prompted us to investigate whether urorenal malformations are part of the phenotypic spectrum of CHUJANS. Analysis of existing CHUJANS and CAKUT cohorts, consulting matchmaking platforms, and systematic literature review to look for additional patients with both CHUJANS and CAKUT. Prenatal expression studies in murine and human renal tissues to investigate the role for PHIP in kidney development. We identified 4 novel and 8 published cases, indicating variable expressivity with a urorenogenital trait frequency of 5% to 35%. The prenatal expression studies supported a role for PHIP in normal kidney and urinary tract development. Pathogenic PHIP gene variants should be considered as causative in patients with syndromal CAKUT. Conversely, patients with CHUJANS should be clinically evaluated for urorenogenital manifestations. Because neurodevelopmental disorders are often associated with kidney phenotypes, an interdisciplinary re-evaluation offers promise in identifying incompletely penetrant kidney associations and uncovering novel molecular mechanisms of disturbed nephrogenesis",PubMed
Rare Congenital Upper Lip Pit,"Congenital lip pits are characterized by sinuses or fistulas in the lips that can occur in isolation or as part of a genetic disorder. A 6-year-old girl with a right upper lip lesion present at birth presented with recurrent swelling and occasional erythema. Examination revealed a mildly swollen punctum at the right upper wet/dry vermillion with expressible serous drainage. There were no other phenotypic or cognitive concerns. The lesion was surgically excised using vertical wedge resection. The postoperative course showed well well-healed incision. The pathology report confirmed a lip pit. The family was referred to genetics for further evaluation. Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is a genetic disorder associated with abnormal development of the paramedian lip. Most congenital lip pits are primarily found on the lower lips, with paramedian lip pits being the most common. Upper lateral lip pits with or without accompanying lip pits are considerably rarer. Though VWS is commonly associated with mutations in the interferon regulatory factor 6 or grainyhead-like protein 3 genes, ~25% of affected individuals lack an identified genetic etiology. A high index of suspicion for VWS is warranted if lip pits are present in the absence of other phenotypic abnormalities and should prompt genetic testing for interferon regulatory factor 6 and grainyhead-like protein 3 mutations. Multidisciplinary teams should consider patient self-esteem, quality of life, and potential family planning when deciding on surgical intervention for lip pits. Surgical management of pits should entail tissue-preserving techniques such as vertical wedge resection and inverted T-lip reduction to prevent whistle-lip deformity",PubMed
Dose escalation pre-clinical trial of novel Dok7-AAV in mouse model of DOK7 congenital myasthenia,"Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a group of inherited disorders characterised by defective neuromuscular transmission and fatigable muscle weakness. Mutations in DOK7, a gene encoding a post-synaptic protein crucial in the formation and stabilisation of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), rank among the leading three prevalent causes of CMS in diverse populations globally. The majority of DOK7 CMS patients experience varying degrees of disability despite receiving optimised treatment, necessitating the development of improved therapeutic approaches. Here we executed a dose escalation pre-clinical trial using a DOK7-CMS mouse model to assess the efficacy of Amp-101, an innovative AAV gene replacement therapy. Amp-101 is based on AAVrh74 and contains human DOK7 cDNA under the control of a muscle-restricted promoter. We show that at doses 6x1013vg/kg and 1x1014 vg/kg, Amp-101 generated enlarged NMJs and rescued the very severe phenotype of the model. Treated mice became at least as strong as WT littermates and the diaphragm and tibialis anterior muscles displayed robust expression of DOK7. This data suggests that Amp-101 is a promising candidate to move forward to clinic trials",biorxiv
Challenges of Preimplantation Genetic Counselling in the Context of Cystic Fibrosis and Other CFTR-Related Disorders: A Monocentric Experience in a Cohort of 92 Couples,"Cystic fibrosis is a highly prevalent genetic disorder caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the CFTR gene, causing an altered function of the exocrine glands and a subsequent spectrum of hypofunctional and degenerative manifestations. The increasing availability of carrier screening programmes, the enhanced life expectancy of patients due to improved treatment and care strategies and the development of more precise and affordable molecular diagnostic tools have prompted a rise in demand of prenatal diagnosis procedures for at-risk couples, including Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT). However, challenges remain: heterogeneity among screening programmes, nuances of variant interpretation and availability of novel treatments demand a considerate and knowledgeable approach to genetic counselling. In this work, we retrospectively evaluated the molecular data of 92 unselected couples who received a diagnosis of CFTR-related status and were referred to the genetics clinic at the University Hospital of Padua for genetic counselling on eligibility for PGT. A total of 50 couples were considered eligible for the procedure based on risk of transmitting biallelic pathogenic variants. We report and discuss our experience with this case series in the context of the Italian medical care system and present an overview of the most relevant issues regarding genetic counselling for PGT in CFTR-related disorders",PubMed
Deep learning predicts DNA methylation regulatory variants in specific brain cell types and enhances fine mapping for brain disorders,"DNA methylation (DNAm) is essential for brain development and function and potentially mediates the effects of genetic risk variants underlying brain disorders. We present INTERACT, a transformer-based deep learning model to predict regulatory variants impacting DNAm levels in specific brain cell types, leveraging existing single-nucleus DNAm data from the human brain. We show that INTERACT accurately predicts cell type-specific DNAm profiles, achieving an average area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.98 across cell types. Furthermore, INTERACT predicts cell type-specific DNAm regulatory variants, which reflect cellular context and enrich the heritability of brain-related traits in relevant cell types. Importantly, we demonstrate that incorporating predicted variant effects and DNAm levels of CpG sites enhances the fine mapping for three brain disorders--schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimers disease--and facilitates mapping causal genes to particular cell types. Our study highlights the power of deep learning in identifying cell type-specific regulatory variants, which will enhance our understanding of the genetics of complex traits.  TeaserDeep learning reveals genetic variations impacting brain cell type-specific DNA methylation and illuminates genetic bases of brain disorders",biorxiv
Bridging the Gap Between the Bench and Bedside: Clinical Applications of High-density Lipoprotein Function,"Decades of research have reshaped our understanding of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) , shifting our focus from cholesterol (C) levels to multifaceted functionalities. Epidemiological studies initially suggested an association between HDL-C levels and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; however, such a simple association has not been indicated by recent studies. Notably, genome-wide studies have highlighted discrepancies between HDL-C levels and CVD outcomes, urging a deeper exploration of the role of HDL. The key to this shift lies in elucidating the role of HDL in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), which is a fundamental anti-atherosclerotic mechanism. Understanding RCT has led to the identification of therapeutic targets and novel interventions for atherosclerosis. However, clinical trials have underscored the limitations of HDL-C as a therapeutic target, prompting the re-evaluation of the role of HDL in disease prevention. Further investigations have revealed the involvement of HDL composition in various diseases other than CVD, including chronic kidney disease, Alzheimer's disease, and autoimmune diseases. The anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anti-infectious properties of HDL have emerged as crucial aspects of its protective function, opening new avenues for novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Omics technologies have provided insights into the diverse composition of HDL, revealing disease-specific alterations in the HDL proteome and lipidome. In addition, combining cell-based and cell-free assays has facilitated the evaluation of the HDL functionality across diverse populations, offering the potential for personalized medicine. Overall, a comprehensive understanding of HDL multifunctionality leads to promising prospects for future clinical applications and therapeutic developments, extending beyond cardiovascular health",PubMed
Enhancing Recognition and Interpretation of Functional Phenotypic Sequences through Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Genomic Models,"Decoding high-quality human genomic sequences requires comprehensive analysis of DNA sequence functionality. Through computational and experimental approaches, researchers study the genotype-phenotype relationship and generate important datasets that help unravel complicated genetic blueprints. This study explores the use of deep learning, particularly pre-trained models like DNA_bert_6 and human_gpt2-v1, in interpreting and representing human genome sequences. We meticulously construct multiple datasets linking genotypes and phenotypes to fine-tune pre-trained models for precise DNA sequence classification. Furthermore, we specifically focused on the human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) dataset with commendable classification performance (both binary and multi-classification accuracy and F1 values above 0.935 and 0.888, respectively). We evaluate the influence of sequence length on classification results and analyze the impact of feature extraction in the models hidden layers using the HERV dataset. To further understand the phenotype-specific patterns learned by the model, we perform enrichment, pathogenicity and conservation analyzes of specific motifs in the HERV sequence with high average local representation weight (LRAW) scores. Overall, the generated datasets further provide numerous additional genotype-phenotype datasets for evaluating the performance of genomic models. The findings highlight the potential of large models in learning DNA sequence representations, particularly when utilizing the HERV dataset, and provide valuable insights for future research. This work represents an innovative strategy that combines pre-trained model representations with classical omics methods for analyzing the functionality of genome sequences, fostering cross-fertilization between genomics and advanced AI.

Notably, the fine-tuning of the HERV dataset not only improved our ability to identify and distinguish diverse information types within DNA sequences but also successfully identified specific motifs associated with neurological disorders and cancers in regions with high ALRW scores. Subsequent analysis of these motifs shed light on the adaptive responses of species to environmental pressures and their co-evolution with pathogens. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained genomic models in learning DNA sequence representations, particularly when utilizing the HERV dataset, and provide valuable insights for future research endeavors.

Ube3a unsilencer for the potential treatment of Angelman syndrome,"Deletion of the maternal UBE3A allele causes Angelman syndrome (AS); because paternal UBE3A is epigenetically silenced by a long non-coding antisense (UBE3A-ATS) in neurons, this nearly eliminates UBE3A protein in the brain. Reactivating paternal UBE3A holds promise for treating AS. We previously showed topoisomerase inhibitors can reactivate paternal UBE3A, but their therapeutic challenges prompted our search for small molecule unsilencers with a different mechanism of action. Here, we found that (S)-PHA533533 acts through a novel mechanism to significantly increase paternal Ube3a mRNA and UBE3A protein levels while downregulating Ube3a-ATS in primary neurons derived from AS model mice. Furthermore, peripheral delivery of (S)-PHA533533 in AS model mice induces widespread neuronal UBE3A expression. Finally, we show that (S)-PHA533533 unsilences paternal UBE3A in AS patient-derived neurons, highlighting its translational potential. Our findings provide a lead for developing a small molecule treatment for AS that could be safe, non-invasively delivered, and capable of brain-wide unsilencing of paternal UBE3A",PubMed
Phenformin's impact on lifespan in C. elegans is resilient to environmental factors that inhibit metformin-induced longevity downstream of skn-1/Nrf and AMP-activated protein kinase,"Despite being principally prescribed to treat type 2 diabetes, biguanides, especially metformin and phenformin, have been shown to extend lifespan and healthspan in preclinical models, and to reduce the impact of aging-associated diseases such as cancer. While there have been conflicting results in studies involving rodents and humans, consistent evidence from laboratories worldwide, including our own, indicates metformin and phenformins ability to significantly extend lifespan in C. elegans. However, the pro-longevity effect of metformin can vary depending on environmental conditions. Specifically, the choice of agar from different manufacturers or batches influences metformins ability to extend lifespan in C. elegans. We traced ability of certain agar batches to interfere with metformin-prompted lifespan extension to the presence of a factor that acts directly in the worm, independently of the bacterial food source, that prevents longevity promoting effects downstream of longevity effectors skn-1 and AMPK. In contrast, phenformin prompts robust lifespan extension in the face of environmental changes and exhibits broad positive effects in aging across genetically diverse Caenorhabditis species where the impact of metformin is highly variable. Thus metformin effects in aging are impacted by heretofore unappreciated environmental factors. Phenformin may represent a more robust agent with which to understand the longevity promoting mechanisms downstream of biguanides",biorxiv
Opportunities for Improving Detection of Cancer Predisposition Syndromes in Pediatric Solid Tumor Patients,"Detection of cancer predisposition syndromes (CPS) depends on identifying risk factors, including tumor type, family history, and physical findings, to prompt referral for genetic counseling/testing. Whether pediatric oncology providers (POPs) collect adequate family history information is unknown. A single-institution retrospective chart review of solid tumor patients <18 years of age referred for a CPS evaluation between January 1, 2017 and January 31, 2019 was performed. POP adherence to American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) family history collection recommendations was measured and compared with genetic counselor performance. Whether sufficient family history was documented to satisfy the criteria of three genetic counseling referral guidelines [American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG), updated Jongmans (UJ), and McGill Interactive Pediatric OncoGenetic Guidelines (MIPOGG)] was evaluated. POPs and genetic counselors achieved all 6 ASCO family history metrics in 3% and 99% of 129 eligible cases, respectively. POPs failed to document sufficient family history to satisfy genetic counseling referral criteria in most cases (74% ACMG, 73% UJ, 79% MIPOGG). POPs perform poorly in family history collection, raising concern that some patients at risk for a CPS based on their family history may not be referred for genetic counseling/testing. Interventions to improve family history collection are needed to enhance CPS detection",PubMed
Illuminating the Terminal Nerve: Uncovering the Link between GnRH-1 and Olfactory Development,"During embryonic development, the olfactory placode (OP) generates migratory neurons, including olfactory pioneer neurons, cells of the terminal nerve (TN), Gonadotropin-releasing hormone-1 (GnRH-1) neurons, and other uncharacterized neurons. Pioneer neurons from the olfactory placode induce olfactory bulb morphogenesis.  In mice, GnRH-1 neurons appear in the olfactory system around mid-gestation and migrate via the terminal nerve axons to different brain regions. The GnRH-1 neurons are crucial in controlling the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Kallmann syndrome is characterized by impaired olfactory system development, defective olfactory bulbs, defective secretion of GnRH-1, and infertility. The precise mechanistic link between the olfactory system and GnRH-1 development remains unclear. Studies in humans and mice highlight the importance of the Prokineticin-2/Prokineticin-Receptor-2 (Prokr2) signaling pathway in olfactory bulb morphogenesis and GnRH-1 neuronal migration. Prokr2 loss-of-function mutations can cause Kallmann syndrome, and hence the Prokr2 signaling pathway represents a unique model to decipher the olfactory/GnRH-1 connection. We discovered that Prokr2 is expressed in the TN neurons during the critical period of GnRH-1 neuron formation, migration, and induction of olfactory bulb morphogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified that the TN is formed by neurons that are distinct from the olfactory neurons. The TN neurons express multiple genes associated with KS. Our study suggests that the aberrant development of pioneer/TN neurons might cause the KS spectrum.  Key Points1) Pioneer or terminal nerve neurons play a crucial role in initiating the development of the olfactory bulbs. We found that the Prokineticin Receptor-2 gene, associated with Kallmann syndrome, is expressed by the olfactory pioneer/terminal nerve neurons. 2) We genetically traced, isolated, and conducted Single-cell RNA sequencing on terminal nerve neurons of rodents. This analysis revealed a significant enrichment of gene expression related to Kallmann syndrome. 3) Our study indicates that the investigation of Pioneer/terminal nerve neurons should be a pivotal focal point for comprehending developmental defects affecting olfactory and GnRH-1 systems",biorxiv
Insulin-AKT1-YBX1 Regulation of ANGPTL8 Promote Lipogenesis in OSA-Associated Dyslipidemia,"Dyslipidemia is a hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-induced metabolic syndrome, yet the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We conducted a genome-wide association study on lipid traits in the OSA cohorts, identifying the SNP rs3745683 in ANGPTL8, significantly associated with reductions in multiple lipid traits. ANGPTL8, an essential lipogenic hormone and potential therapeutic target for metabolic syndrome, showed elevated expression in OSA patients compared to healthy controls, strongly correlated with increased insulin levels. Notably, ANGPTL8 expression can be upregulated by insulin stimulation, indicating it as an insulin-responsive hormone regulating dyslipidemia in OSA. Mechanistically, SNP rs3745683 attenuated ANGPTL8 transcription by inhibiting its binding to transcription factor YBX1. Insulin prompted AKT1 to phosphorylate YBX1 at Ser102, facilitating YBX1s nuclear translocation and subsequent regulation of ANGPTL8 expression and lipid synthesis. Specific knockdown of YBX1 in mouse liver confirmed its necessity for ANGPTL8 expression and hepatic lipid synthesis in vivo. Our findings highlight ANGPTL8 as a critical regulator of dyslipidemia in OSA patients, offering a promising therapeutic avenue for managing metabolic syndrome in OSA",medrxiv
Diagnostic Challenges in a Family with Dominant Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa and Isolated Hereditary Nail Disorder: Paternal Gonosomal Mosaicism for COL7A1 Mutation and Maternal RSPO4 Variant,"Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) has long been recognized as a well-known genodermatosis, caused by COL7A1 gene pathogenic variants. Isolated anonychia associated with RSPO4 gene mutation is a recently described non-syndromic autosomal recessive condition. In this family, a 13-year-old girl presented with severe epidermolysis bullosa symptoms. Family history revealed milder but similar complaints in the siblings, and anonychia affecting all nails in the mother and maternal relatives. The father did not have any signs of DEB. Genetic testing revealed heterozygous c.6127G>A (p.Gly2043Arg) variant in the COL7A1 (NM_000094.4) gene, in the proband and her affected siblings. The variant was not detected in the mother or father, prompting investigation into parental mosaicism. Detection of the variant in sperm sample suggested paternal mosaicism. Additionally, RSPO4 gene (NM_001029871.4) was sequenced in the mother and two of her affected sisters for suspected non-syndromic isolated anonychia, revealing homozygous c.79+1G>A variant. Isolated nail disease in the mother was initially thought to be the result of DDEB nails-only subtype and the DEB in the children was inherited from the mother. However, further clinical and genetic investigation showed that the condition in the patient and her siblings arose from gonosomal mosaicism in the father and the nail phenotype in the mother is a separate coincidental condition. This report aims to serve as an example for similar cases and highlight the importance of detailed genetic analysis guided by comprehensive medical history in reaching a diagnosis",PubMed
Identifying Health Risks from Family History: A Survey of Natural Language Processing Techniques,"Electronic health records include information on patients' status and medical history, which could cover the history of diseases and disorders that could be hereditary. One important use of family history information is in precision health, where the goal is to keep the population healthy with preventative measures. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques can assist with identifying information that could assist health professionals in identifying health risks before a condition is developed in their later years, saving lives and reducing healthcare costs.   We survey the literature on the techniques from the NLP field that have been developed to utilise digital health records to identify risks of familial diseases. We highlight that rule-based methods are heavily investigated and are still actively used for family history extraction. Still, more recent efforts have been put into building neural models based on large-scale pre-trained language models.

Genome-Wide Association Study Finds Multiple Loci Associated with Intraocular Pressure in HS Rats,"Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is influenced by environmental and genetic factors. Increased IOP is a major risk factor for most types of glaucoma, including primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Investigating the genetic basis of IOP may lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of POAG. The goal of this study was to identify genetic loci involved in regulating IOP using outbred heterogeneous stock (HS) rats. HS rats are a multigenerational outbred population derived from eight inbred strains that have been fully sequenced. This population is ideal for genome-wide association studies (GWASs) owing to the accumulated recombinations among well-defined haplotypes, the relatively high allele frequencies, the accessibility to a large collection of tissue samples, and the large allelic effect size compared to human studies. Both male and female HS rats (N=1,812) were used in the study. Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to obtain ~3.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from each individual. SNP heritability for IOP in HS rats was 0.32, which agrees with other studies. We performed a GWAS for the IOP phenotype using a linear mixed model and used permutation to determine a genome-wide significance threshold. We identified three genome-wide significant loci for IOP on chromosomes 1, 5, and 16. Next, we sequenced the mRNA of 51 whole eye samples to find cis-eQTLs to aid in identification of candidate genes. We report 5 candidate genes within those loci: Tyr, Ctsc, Plekhf2, Ndufaf6 and Angpt2. Tyr, Ndufaf6 and Angpt2 genes have been previously implicated by human GWAS of IOP-related conditions. Ctsc and Plekhf2 genes represent novel findings that may provide new insight into the molecular basis of IOP. This study highlights the efficacy of HS rats for investigating the genetics of elevated IOP and identifying potential candidate genes for future functional testing.  Contribution to the field statementGlaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only known modifiable risk factor. This study describes results of the genome-wide association study (GWAS) performed in outbred rats that identifies known and novel genes involved in IOP regulation. To our knowledge, this is the first GWAS performed for IOP in a rat model. Identifying novel candidate genes in the rat model provides insight into the risk factors for glaucoma in humans and potential pharmacological targets for regulating IOP. The rat model is advantageous for studying natural variations in IOP, controlling environmental exposures, and providing easier access to tissue that can be used in phenotyping and gene expression in future studies",biorxiv
Significance of aberrant DNA methylation for cancer diagnostics and therapy,"Epigenetics is a scientific field that covers changes in gene expression that are not caused by the alteration of the nucleotide sequence in the DNA strand. Together with sequential changes, epigenetic reprogramming is a recognized cancer hallmark driving carcinogenesis. The underlying mechanisms of epigenetically-driven gene expression changes are diverse. However, one of the most extensively studied mechanisms is a change in DNA methylation. Under physiological conditions, DNA methylation ensures tissue-specific gene silencing and helps to maintain genome stability. With malignant transformation, genomic DNA undergoes global hypomethylation as well as locus-specific hypermethylation in promoters of tumor suppressor genes. In the last few decades, specific aberrant DNA methylation changes have emerged as both cancer-associated biomarkers and therapeutic targets and prompted ongoing efforts to enhance both diagnostic and therapeutic means in oncology. The main purpose of this review is to introduce both established and emerging DNA methylation-based biomarkers for cancer diagnostics with a focus on biomarkers that are either routinely used or have been developed as commercial tests with certification for their use within in vitro diagnostics. Furthermore, therapeutic options for targeting aberrant DNA methylation are described, including both approved compounds and newly developed agents undergoing clinical investigation",PubMed
COMT Variants are Associated With Breast and Nipple Pain,"Estimates suggest that only 24.9% of infants born in 2019 were exclusively breastfed before 6 months of age, despite the known health benefits of exclusive breastfeeding. Breast and nipple pain is one of the primary determinants of exclusive breastfeeding. Environmental contributions to breastfeeding success have been reported extensively in the literature, but the contribution(s) of maternal genetics has yet to be discovered. The purpose of the study was to identify an association between pain and lactation-related gene variants with exclusive breastfeeding determinants. We selected 4 genes having single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with potential functional significance in breastfeeding and pain: prolactin receptor (PRLR), oxytocin receptor (OXTR), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and milk fat globule epidermal growth factor and factor V/VIII domain containing (MFGE8). We performed a cross-sectional secondary analysis of a longitudinal randomized controlled trial study, Promoting Self-Management of Breast and Nipple Pain with Biomarkers and Technology for Breastfeeding Women (NCT05262920). Breast and nipple pain, perceived insufficient milk, and breastfeeding self-efficacy were examined using total scale scores for the Brief Pain Inventory, Visual Analog Scale, H&H Lactation Scale, and the Breastfeeding Self-efficacy Scale-short form, respectively. Of the candidate genes examined, SNPs within COMT were significantly associated with breastfeeding-related outcomes. Specifically, COMT rs4633 and rs4680 minor allele carriers (T, A) reported higher breast and nipple pain intensity than women homozygous for the major allele (C, G). COMT is the most widely researched ""pain gene"" and has been linked to cold, postoperative, and postpartum pain. This study is the first to identify a contribution of COMT variants to breast and nipple pain and, as a result, to breastfeeding exclusivity. PERSPECTIVE: Two SNPs in the pain gene COMT are associated with breast and nipple pain. Clinically, a minor allele in COMT rs4633 and rs4680 may increase a woman's rating of moderate breast and nipple pain. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROMPT was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (protocol #NCT05262920)",PubMed
Discovery of pathogenic variants in EFEMP2 and RAG1 and undetectable fetal phenotype: A challenge of prenatal exome sequencing,"Exome sequencing in prenatal context confronts with pathogenic variants associated with phenotypes that are not detectable prenatally. A consanguineous couple was referred at 24 weeks of gestation for prenatal genetic investigations after ultrasonography findings including decreased fetal movements, hypoplastic male external genitalia, retrognathia, prefrontal edema, anomalies of the great vessels with pulmonary atresia and dilated tortuous aorta. Prenatal trio exome sequencing identified two homozygous likely pathogenic variants, i.e. a missense in EFEMP2 involved in cutis laxa and a nonsense in RAG1 involved in several types of severe combined immunodeficiency. The fetal ultrasonographic phenotype was partially compatible with previously reported prenatal presentations secondary to EFEMP2 biallelic variants, but prenatal presentations have never been reported for RAG1 related disorders because the RAG1 phenotype is undetectable during pregnancy. Both EFEMP2 and RAG1 variants were disclosed to the couple because the EFEMP2 variant was considered causative for the fetal ultrasonographic phenotype and the RAG1 variant was considered a finding of strong interest for genetic counselling and monitoring of future pregnancies following the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations about the discovery of incidental findings in fetal exome sequencing in prenatal diagnosis",PubMed
The Use of Expanded Carrier Screening in Reproductive Medicine: Scientific Impact Paper No. 74,"Expanded carrier screening (ECS) is a genetic screening test carried out by analysing a blood sample. This screen can be used to detect whether the individual unknowingly carries gene variants associated with common genetic conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, that may be passed on to their children. It is typically performed in reproductive medicine for those who are considering having a family either naturally or via fertility treatment. Many donor sperm and egg banks, particularly in the USA and Europe, also perform blanket ECS testing on all their prospective sperm and egg donors. ECS is not currently routine practice in the UK, but a growing number of patients are requesting it before treatment. All of us carry gene variants of some sort that may cause autosomal recessive disease in their children if their partner or donor also carry a variant in the same gene. An autosomal recessive disease means two copies of an abnormal gene must be present in order for the disease or trait (such as cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease) to develop. One copy of the variant means the person is a carrier but does not have the condition. Two copies, i.e. from the mother and father, means the child has a 25% chance of having the genetic disease. Carrying a gene variant does not mean that the individual would necessarily have any symptoms of the disease or any features of the condition. Genetic tests for specific conditions are currently available either before or during pregnancy for prospective parents who have a family or personal history of a genetic condition, or for those from ethnic backgrounds where certain conditions - such as haemoglobinopathies (blood disorders) - are common, prompting referral to a clinical genetics department. Expanded carrier screens may test for more than 100 genetic conditions. The list of conditions screened for is called a panel. Common panels are 250 or 600 genes. Not all expanded carrier screens that are available analyse the same genes. Some may test for genes that do not cause serious disease, or cause diseases that occur in later life; others test for genes that cause severe conditions in childhood. There is no agreement as to which panel of genes should be tested for in an ECS. Understanding the screening that is being offered, and the meaning of any results, is complicated and requires support from appropriately trained professionals to best inform the prospective parent or parents",PubMed
Fragile X Syndrome: A Review for General Pediatricians,"Fragile X syndrome is the most commonly inherited form of intellectual disability. Identifying fragile X syndrome at a young age can be quite challenging because the classical physical features usually present in late childhood or early adolescence; therefore, it is important to consider genetic testing for all males with unexplained developmental delays, intellectual disability, and autism, females with developmental delays, intellectual disability or autism, and a family history of fragile X gene disorders. There is no specific treatment to manage fragile X syndrome. Still, a prompt referral for early intervention is essential to help maximize the child's learning potential, as well as a referral to child psychology if any behavioral concerns are present. It is of paramount importance for families with a history of fragile X syndrome to have access to genetic counseling as it can aid in future reproductive decisions and the risk of future recurrences of this condition.

NeoGx: Machine-Recommended Rapid Genome Sequencing for Neonates,"Genetic disease is common in the Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), but neonatology providers are not always able to identify the need for genetic evaluation. We trained a machine learning (ML) algorithm to predict the need for genetic testing within the first 18 months of life using health record phenotypes. For a decade of NICU patients, we extracted Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms from clinical text with Natural Language Processing tools. Considering multiple feature sets, classifier architectures, and hyperparameters, we selected a classifier and made predictions on a validation cohort of 2,241 Level IV NICU admits born 2020-2021. Our classifier had ROC AUC of 0.87 and PR AUC of 0.73 when making predictions during the first week in the Level IV NICU. We simulated testing policies under which subjects begin testing at the time of first ML prediction, estimating diagnostic odyssey length both with and without the additional benefit of pursuing rGS at this time. Just by using ML to accelerate initial genetic testing (without changing the tests ordered), the median time to first genetic test dropped from 10 days to 1 day, and the number of diagnostic odysseys resolved within 14 days of NICU admission increased by a factor of 1.8. By additionally requiring rGS at the time of positive ML prediction, the number of diagnostic odysseys resolved within 14 days was 3.8 times higher than the baseline. ML predictions of genetic testing need, together with the application of the right rapid testing modality, can help providers accelerate genetics evaluation and bring about earlier and better outcomes for patients

Evaluating ChatGPT as an Agent for Providing Genetic Education,"Genetic disorders are complex and can greatly impact an individuals health and well-being. In this study, we assess the ability of ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI, to answer questions related to three specific genetic disorders: BRCA1, MLH1, and HFE. ChatGPT has shown it can supply articulate answers to a wide spectrum of questions. However, its ability to answer questions related to genetic disorders has yet to be evaluated. The aim of this study is to perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of ChatGPTs performance in this area. The ability of ChatGPT to provide accurate and useful information to patients was assessed by genetic experts. Here we show that ChatGPT answered 64.7% of the 68 genetic questions asked and was able to respond coherently to complex questions related to the three genes/conditions. Our results reveal that ChatGPT can provide valuable information to individuals seeking information about genetic disorders, however, it still has some limitations and inaccuracies, particularly in understanding human inheritance patterns. The results of this study have implications for both genomics and medicine and can inform future developments in this area. AI platforms, like ChatGPT, have significant potential in the field of genomics. As these technologies become integrated into consumer-facing products, appropriate oversight is required to ensure accurate and safe delivery of medical information. With such oversight and training specifically for genetic information, these platforms could have the potential to augment some clinical interactions",biorxiv
Genetic InfoMax: Exploring Mutual Information Maximization in High-Dimensional Imaging Genetics Studies,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are used to identify relationships between genetic variations and specific traits. When applied to high-dimensional medical imaging data, a key step is to extract lower-dimensional, yet informative representations of the data as traits. Representation learning for imaging genetics is largely under-explored due to the unique challenges posed by GWAS in comparison to typical visual representation learning. In this study, we tackle this problem from the mutual information (MI) perspective by identifying key limitations of existing methods. We introduce a trans-modal learning framework Genetic InfoMax (GIM), including a regularized MI estimator and a novel genetics-informed transformer to address the specific challenges of GWAS. We evaluate GIM on human brain 3D MRI data and establish standardized evaluation protocols to compare it to existing approaches. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of GIM and a significantly improved performance on GWAS",arXiv
"Just-DNA-Seq, open-source personal genomics platform: longevity science for everyone","Genomic data has become increasingly accessible to the general public with the advent of companies offering whole genome sequencing at a relatively low cost. However, their reports are not verifiable due to a lack of crucial details and transparency: polygenic risk scores do not always mention all the polymorphisms involved. Simultaneously, tackling the manual investigation and interpretation of data proves challenging for individuals lacking a background in genetics. Currently, there is no open-source or commercial solution that provides comprehensive longevity reports surpassing a limited number of polymorphisms. Additionally, there are no ready-made, out-of-the-box solutions available that require minimal expertise to generate reports independently. To address these issues, we have developed the Just-DNA-Seq open-source genomic platform. Just-DNA-Seq aims to provide a user-friendly solution to genome annotation by allowing users to upload their own VCF files and receive annotations of their genetic variants and polygenic risk scores related to longevity. We also created GeneticsGenie custom GPT that can answer genetics questions based on our modules. With the Just-DNA-Seq platform, we want to provide full information regarding the genetics of long life: disease-predisposing variants, that can reduce lifespan and manifest at different age (cardiovascular, oncological, neurodegenerative diseases, etc.), pro-longevity variants and longevity drug pharmacokinetics. In this research article, we will discuss the features and capabilities of Just-DNA-Seq, and how it can benefit individuals looking to understand and improve their health. It's crucial to note that the Just-DNA-Seq platform is exclusively intended for scientific and informational purposes and is not suitable for medical applications",arXiv
Protocol for a type 3 hybrid implementation cluster randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of patient and clinician nudges to advance the use of genomic medicine across a diverse health system,"Germline genetic testing is recommended for an increasing number of conditions with underlying genetic etiologies, the results of which impact medical management. However, genetic testing is underutilized in clinics due to system, clinician, and patient level barriers. Behavioral economics provides a framework to create implementation strategies, such as nudges, to address these multi-level barriers and increase the uptake of genetic testing for conditions where the results impact medical management. Patients meeting eligibility for germline genetic testing for a group of conditions will be identified using electronic phenotyping algorithms. A pragmatic, type 3 hybrid cluster randomization study will test nudges to patients and/or clinicians, or neither. Clinicians who receive nudges will be prompted to either refer their patient to genetics or order genetic testing themselves. We will use rapid cycle approaches informed by clinician and patient experiences, health equity, and behavioral economics to optimize these nudges before trial initiation. The primary implementation outcome is uptake of germline genetic testing for the pre-selected health conditions. Patient data collected through the electronic health record (e.g. demographics, geocoded address) will be examined as moderators of the effect of nudges. This study will be one of the first randomized trials to examine the effects of patient- and clinician-directed nudges informed by behavioral economics on uptake of genetic testing. The pragmatic design will facilitate a large and diverse patient sample, allow for the assessment of genetic testing uptake, and provide comparison of the effect of different nudge combinations. This trial also involves optimization of patient identification, test selection, ordering, and result reporting in an electronic health record-based infrastructure to further address clinician-level barriers to utilizing genomic medicine. The findings may help determine the impact of low-cost, sustainable implementation strategies that can be integrated into health care systems to improve the use of genomic medicine.

Silvery Gray Hair Syndrome With Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis: A Case Report,"Griscelli syndrome (GS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, which has been classified into three subtypes based on clinical and genetic differences. GS subtype 2 is commonly associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and recurrent infections due to immunodeficiency. In this study, we describe a four-month-old boy with genetically proven GS2, with neurological and immunological manifestations. He presented with fever, refusal of feeds, drowsiness, and multiple episodes of seizures. Examination revealed hypopigmented skin, silvery gray hair, and organomegaly. The child developed features of HLH, fulfilling clinical and laboratory criteria. Neuroimaging findings were in concordance with HLH of the central nervous system. Microscopic examination of the hair showed clumps of melanin pigment along the hair shaft. All findings were in favor of GS type 2, complicated with HLH, which was later confirmed with a homozygous deletion of the RAB27A gene on exome sequencing. Unfortunately, the baby succumbed to death due to severe sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction. The silvery gray hair, with typical hair microscopic findings, and association with HLH are strong indicators for this potentially fatal condition and aid in prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only lifesaving treatment option",PubMed
A qualitative feasibility study of a prototype patient-centered video intervention to increase uptake of cancer genetic testing among Black Americans,"Health advances due to developments in genomic medicine are unequally experienced in the USA; racial differences in the uptake of genetic testing are one factor in this disparity. In collaboration with Black patients and diverse health care providers, we are developing a patient-centered video intervention to increase cancer genetic testing among eligible Black Americans. The objective of the pilot work is to explore the acceptability of and support for the intervention and key content components. In order to create a patient-centered video intervention prototype, we conducted a targeted, secondary analysis of 47 coded transcripts from video-taped qualitative interviews with people with a known genetic or inherited cancer risk. The review focused on decision-making, testing experiences, and perceived value of genetic testing. We subsequently generated a 15-min video montage of content from 9 diverse (age, gender, race) participants. We used the prototype video as prompt material for semi-structured interviews with 10 Black patients who had undergone genetic testing in the last 2 years and 10 racially diverse providers (genetic counselors, a nurse, and medical oncologists) who provide management recommendations for high-risk patients. Interviews sought to understand the acceptability of a video intervention to enhance informed decision-making by Black patients and key elements for intervention efficacy. Study participants were generally positive about the prototype video and provided guidance for intervention development. Interviewed patients prioritized perceived authenticity and relatability of video participants. The presentation of patients' perspectives on testing, their experiences of testing, and the benefits of having test results were all seen as useful. The benefits of testing for self and family were identified as important considerations. Privacy concerns and science skepticism were identified as germane issues, with guidance to present barriers to testing alongside possible solutions. The inclusion of clinicians was seen as potentially useful but with caution that clinicians are not universally trusted. Study findings provided critical input for the creation of a professionally produced, tailored intervention video for a randomized clinical trial with Black Americans to evaluate the influence on uptake of genetic testing. The interviews suggest the acceptability and potential utility of an authentic, realistic, and tailored, patient-centered video intervention to increase consideration and uptake of genetic testing",PubMed
Novel mutation of transferrin receptor 2 causing hereditary hemochromatosis type 3 in a Japanese patient,"Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is recognized as a progressive iron-storage disorder, and leading to severe organ impairments, including liver cirrhosis. Hereditary hemochromatosis type 3 arises from mutations in the transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) gene. However, HH type 3 is rare in Asia, and information regarding genetic mutations and associated phenotypes remains limited. Here, we reported the case of a Japanese patient with HH type 3, with a novel homozygous mutation of the TFR2 gene. A 69-year-old woman presented to our hospital with hand joint pain and was referred due to liver impairment. Viral hepatitis and autoimmune liver diseases were ruled out. However, the transferrin saturation was 92.2%, and the serum ferritin level was 1611.8 ng/mL. Additionally, abdominal computed tomography showed diffuse increased density of the liver parenchyma. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging also suggested iron deposition. There is no history of prior treatments involving blood transfusions or iron agents. Her parents were involved in a consanguineous marriage, prompting genetic testing. She had a homozygous novel mutation, c.1337G>A (p.G446E), in the TFR2 gene. Serum hepcidin-25 level was decreased to 2.9 ng/mL. According to the American Society of Medical Genetics and Genomics guideline, the mutation was classified as likely pathogenic, leading to the diagnosis of HH type 3. Following phlebotomy, her arthritis resolved, and serum transaminase levels were normalized. This case marks the first demonstration of homozygous mutation, c.1337G>A (p.G446E), in the TFR2 gene in patients with HH type 3",PubMed
Recurrent Ipsilateral C5 Nerve Palsy Associated With Hereditary Neuropathy With Liability to Pressure Palsy,"Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by heteroplasmic deletion of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. HNPP typically presents with clinical features such as peroneal nerve palsy or cubital tunnel syndrome, which are caused by mechanical compression. Diagnosing cases where neuropathy is absent at the pressure site can be challenging. This is a case study of an 18-year-old man who underwent surgery on the left side of his neck over 10 years ago to remove lymphadenopathy. Following the surgery, he experienced recurrent weakness but only sought medical attention when muscle weakness persisted for longer than a week postoperatively. Upon admission, the patient exhibited neurological symptoms consistent with C5 neuropathy, mainly affecting the deltoid muscles. No serological abnormalities were found to be associated with neuropathy. Neither magnetic resonance imaging nor computed tomography scans detected any lesions around the C5 nerve root. The posture during sleep was believed to cause excessive extension of the C5 nerve root, leading to the assumption that there was some vulnerability in the nerve. A transient sensory loss in the area innervated by the ulnar nerve prompted us to examine the fluorescence in situ hybridization study on the blood sample, which revealed a deletion of the PMP22 gene. The patient was diagnosed with HNPP and was advised to avoid risky postures. Following the implementation of these lifestyle changes, he did not experience any further weakness in his shoulders",PubMed
Crispant analysis in zebrafish as a tool for rapid functional screening of disease-causing genes for bone fragility,"Heritable Fragile Bone Disorders (FBDs) encompass a spectrum of conditions, from widespread multifactorial to rare monogenic diseases, all characterized by an elevated risk of fractures. The process of validating causative genes and elucidating their pathogenic mechanisms remains a daunting and resource-intensive task. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of a semi-high throughput zebrafish screening platform for rapid validation and in vivo functional testing and validation of candidate disease-causing genes for a wide range of heritable FBDs. Six genes associated with severe recessive forms of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) and four genes associated with BMD, a key osteoporosis indicator, identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were selected. The crispant screening approach, based on CRISPR/Cas9 technology, was used to phenotype directly in F0 mosaic founder zebrafish. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis revealed a mean indel efficiency of 88% across ten different crispants, indicating a high proportion of knock-out alleles and thus resembling stable knock-out models. We applied multiple techniques to evaluate skeletal characteristics at 7, 14 and 90 days post-fertilization (dpf), including microscopy for osteoblast reporter visualization and mineralization by Alizarin Red S staining, and microCT for quantitative skeletal analysis. While larval crispants exhibited variable differences in osteoblast-positive and mineralized surface areas, adult-stage crispants displayed more pronounced and consistent skeletal phenotypes. Notably, all crispants developed malformed neural and haemal arches, with a majority presenting vertebral fractures and fusions, and some showing significant alterations in vertebral bone volume and density. In addition, aldh7a1 and mbtps2 crispants experienced increased mortality due to severe skeletal deformities. RT-qPCR analysis of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation markers at larval stages indicated differential expression of osteogenic markers bglap and col1a1a in a substantial portion of the crispants, hinting at their utility as biomarkers for FBD crispant screening. In summary, our findings demonstrate that crispant screening in zebrafish offers a viable and efficient strategy for the functional assessment of FBD genes. We advocate for a comprehensive approach that integrates various techniques and evaluates distinct skeletal and molecular profiles across different developmental and adult stages. This methodology has the potential to provide new insights into the role of these genes in skeletal biology",biorxiv
High-Throughput Phenotyping of Clinical Text Using Large Language Models,"High-throughput phenotyping automates the mapping of patient signs to standardized ontology concepts and is essential for precision medicine. This study evaluates the automation of phenotyping of clinical summaries from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database using large language models. Due to their rich phenotype data, these summaries can be surrogates for physician notes. We conduct a performance comparison of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo. Our results indicate that GPT-4 surpasses GPT-3.5-Turbo in identifying, categorizing, and normalizing signs, achieving concordance with manual annotators comparable to inter-rater agreement. Despite some limitations in sign normalization, the extensive pre-training of GPT-4 results in high performance and generalizability across several phenotyping tasks while obviating the need for manually annotated training data. Large language models are expected to be the dominant method for automating high-throughput phenotyping of clinical text",arXiv
Congenital Bilateral Missing of Permanent Mandibular Second Molars in a 10-Year-Old Child: A Case Report,"Hypodontia is the most common dental developmental disorder. Several underlying mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in its pathogenesis. Occurrence of hypodontia as an isolated trait due to genetic mutations has also been reported. Hypodontia most commonly involves the mandibular premolars, maxillary lateral incisors and second premolars. However, hypodontia of permanent second molars is a rare occurrence. To the best of the author's knowledge, only two studies on orthodontic patients have reported hypodontia of permanent second molars in Iran. This case report describes non-syndromic bilateral missing of permanent mandibular second molars in a 10-year-old child. Clinical examination revealed no systemic underlying condition, and no clinical evidence of any syndrome, or hereditary or familial pattern. Due to the potential impact of hypodontia on the function of dentition, prompt management of hypodontia is imperative. Furthermore, due to the possible mutations associated with hypodontia, additional screening for cancer susceptibility may be recommended",PubMed
Pediatric hypophosphatasia: avoid diagnosis missteps!,"Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is the dento-osseous disorder caused by deactivating mutation(s) of ALPL, the gene that encodes the ""tissue-nonspecific"" isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). In HPP, 3 natural substrates of cell-surface TNSALP accumulate extracellularly; phosphoethanolamine (PEA), inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). Hypophosphatasemia together with elevated plasma levels of PEA, PPi, and PLP comprise its biochemical signature. PPi can inhibit mineralization and in extracellular excess can impair bone and tooth hardening and perhaps explain weak muscle. Autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance from among more than 400 mutations of ALPL largely accounts for HPP's broad-ranging severity, greatest among all skeletal diseases. Pediatric HPP spans life-threatening perinatal and infantile forms, childhood forms, and odonto-HPP selectively featuring premature loss of deciduous teeth. ALPL gene testing and TNSALP supplementation therapy have bolstered familiarity with HPP, but there are new considerations for diagnosis. Herein, diagnosis of a boy's mild childhood HPP was delayed by missteps involving his medical and dental history, physical examination, radiographic findings, and clinical laboratory studies. We review how pediatric HPP is now identified. Prompt diagnosis while appreciating the broad-ranging severity of HPP underlies the safe and effective management of this inborn-error-of-metabolism",PubMed
Lessons learned from the real-world diagnosis and management of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets,"Hypophosphatemic rickets, which is often hereditary, is still under- or misdiagnosed in both children and adults, denying these individuals access to optimal management and genetic counseling. There have been recent calls to compile real-world data and share best practice on these rare conditions to guide clinical decision-making. Here we present eight clinical vignettes of patients with hypophosphatemic rickets encountered in our tertiary pediatric endocrinology practice. We describe the clinical features, genetics, and management of four cases of X-linked hypophosphatemia (PHEX mutations), one each of autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (DMP1 mutation) and autosomal recessive vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1A (CYP27B1 mutation), and two cases of distal renal tubular acidosis with FOXI1 mutation-associated hypophosphatemic rickets. Our cases prompt consideration of the (i) frequent misdiagnosis of hypophosphatemic rickets in clinical practice and the importance of comprehensive genetic testing; (ii) variable expressivity of the causative mutations; and (iii) a lack of responsiveness and/or compliance to conventional therapy and the value of burosumab in modern management, provided access is equitable. These cases highlight common real-world themes and challenges to managing patients presenting with these diverse conditions, especially the burden of disease hidden by misdiagnosis. In sharing these cases, we hope to raise awareness of these conditions, promote best practice in genetic diagnosis and management, and further advocate for reimbursement equity for the best available therapies",PubMed
Large language models identify causal genes in complex trait GWAS,"Identifying underlying causal genes at significant loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) remains a challenging task. Literature evidence for disease-gene co-occurrence, whether through automated approaches or human expert annotation, is one way of nominating causal genes at GWAS loci. However, current automated approaches are limited in accuracy and generalizability, and expert annotation is not scalable to hundreds of thousands of significant findings. Here, we demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can accurately identify genes likely to be causal at loci from GWAS. By evaluating the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on datasets of GWAS loci with high-confidence causal gene annotations, we show that these models outperform state-of-the-art methods in identifying putative causal genes. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to augment existing approaches to causal gene discovery",medrxiv
Polygenic Susceptibility to Diabetes and Poor Glycemic Control in Stroke Survivors,"ImportanceType 2 diabetes mellitus is a highly heritable disease with numerous identified genetic risk variants. However, the concrete role of these variants in the clinical care of stroke patients remains poorly understood.  ObjectiveTo evaluate whether higher polygenic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus (PSD) is associated with worse glycemic control and higher risk of cardiovascular events in stroke survivors.  Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe conducted a 3-stage genetic association study. First, we used a cross-sectional design and data from the UK Biobank to evaluate the relationship between PSD and glycemic control (enrollment took place between 2006 and 2010). Second, we used a cross-sectional design and data from the All of Us Research Program to replicate associations identified in the prior stage (enrollment between 2018 and 2022). Third, we used a prospective design and data from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) clinical trial to evaluate the relationship between PSD and post-stroke acute cardiovascular events (enrollment between 1997 and 2001). The present analyses were performed between May 2022 and August 2023.  ExposuresLow, intermediate, and high PSD modeled through categories of a polygenic risk score that included up to 462 independent DNA sequence variants associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus at genome-wide levels (p<5}10-8).  Main Outcomes and MeasuresHemoglobin A1c levels, treatment-resistant diabetes mellitus (defined as hemoglobin A1c [&ge;] 7.0% despite antidiabetic treatment), and risk of post-stroke acute cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death).  ResultsStage 1 included 5,670 stroke survivors (mean age 61, 41% females), including 1,215 (21%) with known diabetes. Compared to stroke survivors with low PSD, those with high PSD had 35% higher hemoglobin A1c (beta 0.35, standard error [SE] 0.034; p <0.001) and 3 times the risk of having treatment-resistant diabetes (OR 3.40, 95%CI 2.52-6.24; p <0.001). These results pertaining to hemoglobin A1c remained significant when evaluating diabetics and non-diabetics separately (both tests p<0.05). Stage 2 replicated these results in 2,012 stroke survivors, including 447 (22.2%) with diabetes (mean age 64, 52% females, p <0.05 for all tests). Stage 3 included 1,750 stroke survivors (mean age 68, 34.8% females), including 441 (25.2%) with diabetes. Compared to stroke survivors with low PSD, those with high PSD had 50% higher risk of post-stroke cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 1.53, 95%CI 1.03, 2.28, p < 0.05).  Conclusions and RelevanceAmong stroke survivors enrolled in 3 different studies, a higher PSD was associated with poorer glycemic control and higher risk of treatment-resistant diabetes and post-stroke vascular events. Given that millions of Americans are receiving diabetes-related polygenic risk data from direct-to-consumer companies, further research is needed to determine whether precision medicine strategies based on this information can improve the clinical management of these patients.  KEY POINTS  QuestionDoes polygenic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus lead to worse glycemic control and higher risk of cardiovascular events in stroke survivors?  FindingsHigher polygenic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus, modeled via polygenic risk scoring, was associated with higher levels of Hemoglobin A1c, higher risk of treatment resistant diabetes mellitus, and higher risk of recurrent cardiovascular events in stroke survivors.  MeaningPolygenic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes is associated with worse clinical trajectories in stroke survivors. Given that millions of Americans are receiving diabetes-related polygenic risk data from direct-to-consumer companies, further research is needed to understand how this information could help post-stroke clinical management",medrxiv
"Genetic, natal, and spatial drivers of social phenotypes in wild great tits","In social animals, group dynamics profoundly influence collective behaviours, vital in processes like information sharing and predator vigilance. Disentangling the causes of individual-level variation in social behaviours is crucial for understanding the evolution of sociality. This requires unravelling the genetic and environmental basis of these behaviours, which is challenging in uncontrolled wild populations. In this study, we partitioned genetic, developmental and spatial environmental variation in repeatable social network traits derived from foraging events using a multigenerational pedigree and extensive observational social data from a long-term monitored great tit population. Animal models indicated minimal narrow-sense heritability (2-3%) in group size choice, further reduced when spatial location was considered, which itself explains a substantial 30% of the observed variation. Individual gregariousness also had a small genetic component, with a low heritability estimate for degree (<5%). Centrality showed heritability up to 10% in one of three years sampled, whereas betweenness showed none, indicating modest genetic variation in individual sociability, but not group-switching tendencies. These findings suggest a small, albeit detectable, genetic influence on individual sociality, but pronounced spatial effects. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of common environment effects (natal origin and brood identity), which essentially negated genetic effects when explicitly accounted for. In addition, we demonstrate that phenotypic resemblance can be a result of similarities beyond shared genes; spatial proximity at birth and natal environmental similarity explained up to 8% of individual sociability. Our results thus emphasise the role of non-genetic factors, particularly developmental and spatial variation, in shaping individual social behavioural tendencies",biorxiv
Facial Features of Hereditary Cancer Predisposition,"In the age of telehealth medicine, an individual's facial features may provide the only physical clues signaling the presence of a heritable cancer predisposition syndrome. These syndromes include APC-associated polyposis, Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, CYLD cutaneous syndrome, hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer, multiple endocrine neoplasia, neurofibromatosis type 1, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex 1 and 2, among others. Correctly identifying characteristic features is important for genetic and nongenetic specialists as early detection can enable prompt intervention, improving patient outcomes. Advancements in the availability of genetic testing allow patients and their relatives to have more information about their genetic risk profile than before. These changes in clinical pathways, combined with improvements in screening and risk-reducing treatment, highlight the need to outline the cutaneous and morphologic features of high-risk cancer syndromes for clinicians. In this review, we describe the important facial features of hereditary cancer predisposition, with emphasis on diagnosis, cutaneous and extracutaneous manifestations, and screening",PubMed
VarChat: the generative AI assistant for the interpretation of human genomic variations,"In the modern era of genomic research, the scientific community is witnessing an explosive growth in the volume of published findings.

Uptake of Cancer Genetic Services for Chatbot vs Standard-of-Care Delivery Models: The BRIDGE Randomized Clinical Trial,"Increasing numbers of unaffected individuals could benefit from genetic evaluation for inherited cancer susceptibility. Automated conversational agents (ie, chatbots) are being developed for cancer genetics contexts; however, randomized comparisons with standard of care (SOC) are needed. To examine whether chatbot and SOC approaches are equivalent in completion of pretest cancer genetic services and genetic testing. This equivalence trial (Broadening the Reach, Impact, and Delivery of Genetic Services [BRIDGE] randomized clinical trial) was conducted between August 15, 2020, and August 31, 2023, at 2 US health care systems (University of Utah Health and NYU Langone Health). Participants were aged 25 to 60 years, had had a primary care visit in the previous 3 years, were eligible for cancer genetic evaluation, were English or Spanish speaking, had no prior cancer diagnosis other than nonmelanoma skin cancer, had no prior cancer genetic counseling or testing, and had an electronic patient portal account. Participants were randomized 1:1 at the patient level to the study groups at each site. In the chatbot intervention group, patients were invited in a patient portal outreach message to complete a pretest genetics education chat. In the enhanced SOC control group, patients were invited to complete an SOC pretest appointment with a certified genetic counselor. Primary outcomes were completion of pretest cancer genetic services (ie, pretest genetics education chat or pretest genetic counseling appointment) and completion of genetic testing. Equivalence hypothesis testing was used to compare the study groups. This study included 3073 patients (1554 in the chatbot group and 1519 in the enhanced SOC control group). Their mean (SD) age at outreach was 43.8 (9.9) years, and most (2233 of 3063 [72.9%]) were women. A total of 204 patients (7.3%) were Black, 317 (11.4%) were Latinx, and 2094 (75.0%) were White. The estimated percentage point difference for completion of pretest cancer genetic services between groups was 2.0 (95% CI, -1.1 to 5.0). The estimated percentage point difference for completion of genetic testing was -1.3 (95% CI, -3.7 to 1.1). Analyses suggested equivalence in the primary outcomes. The findings of the BRIDGE equivalence trial support the use of chatbot approaches to offer cancer genetic services. Chatbot tools can be a key component of sustainable and scalable population health management strategies to enhance access to cancer genetic services.

"Autosomal Recessive Infantile Hyaline Fibromatosis Identified Using Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing: A Rare, Multisystemic, Hereditary Disorder","Infantile hyaline fibromatosis syndrome (HFS) is an ultra-rare genetic condition characterized by the deposition of hyaline material in the skin, muscle, and viscera. Potential complications include debilitating joint contractures, coarse facial features, recurrent infections, failure to thrive, and death. Here, we present the case of a six-month-old infant with a history of painful extremity contractures, global developmental delay, neck hemangioma, and feeding intolerance presenting to our institution with abdominal distension. The multi-systemic, rapidly progressing, severe nature of her symptoms prompted consultation with inpatient pediatric genetics. Per their recommendation, rapid whole-genome sequencing (rWGS) was done with Fabric GEM®-assisted artificial intelligence (Fabric Genomics, Oakland, California, United States) at Rady Children's Hospital Institute for Genomic Medicine (San Diego, California, United States), revealing homozygous pathogenic variant c.652T>C; P.Cys218Arg in the ANTXR2 gene consistent with HFS. This case was significant not only for its rarity, but also its early manifestation of symptoms, wide range of affected body systems, and severity of symptoms, which together present a fascinating diagnostic dilemma for future clinicians that should be taken into consideration. It also highlights the increasing utility of AI-assisted rWGS as a diagnostic tool for medically complex patients with unknown multisystemic hereditary conditions",PubMed
Untangling the Role of Pathobionts from Bacteroides Species in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) arise from a convergence of underlying genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and shifts in gut microbiota function and membership. Although the latter may trigger and contribute to IBD, there is little consensus on a specific causative pathogen. In this study, we demonstrate that commensal Bacteroides fragilis strains from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients before and during the development of ileal pouchitis engraft and promote colitis in specific pathogen free (SPF) IL-10 deficient (IL-10-/-) mice, but not in wild type SPF mice or when mono-associated in germ free mice. The colitis in IL-10-/- mice was also associated with significant alterations in commensal microbiota potentially important for maintaining intestinal and immune homeostasis. UC pouchitis B. fragilis also engrafts in DSS-induced colitis in WT SPF mice, indicating a fitness advantage under conditions of mucosal inflammation over other commensals in the gut microbiota. These findings show that gut inflammation promotes the expansion and fitness of UC-derived Bacteroides species that is associated with changes in the SPF gut microbiota and may be promote colitis in genetically susceptible hosts.  ImportanceThis study supports the notion that human inflammatory bowel diseases arise from the emergence of indigenous pathobionts in genetically-prone subjects. Colitis-promoting pathobionts are well-suited to establish themselves in the host inflammatory environment and outcompete endogenous microbiota. Once engrafted, the pathobiont can further aggravate inflammation in a genetically-susceptible host. Such complex interplay among several factors creates a vicious pro-inflammatory cycle and promotes disease development. These findings are consistent with our previous clinical observation that B. fragilis, an otherwise low-abundance commensal species, expands prior to the development of UC pouchitis. We believe these findings are relevant to the pathogenesis of UC pouchitis and possibly human inflammatory bowel diseases in general, underscoring the role of commensal to pathobiont transitions, rather than classical pathogens, in promoting and exacerbating the onset of human IBD",biorxiv
Multi-Omics Integration Analysis Pinpoint Proteins Influencing Brain Structure and Function: Toward Drug Targets and Neuroimaging Biomarkers for Neuropsychiatric Disorders,"Integrating protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) data and summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of brain image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) can benefit in identifying IDP-related proteins. Here, we developed a systematic omics-integration analytic framework by sequentially using proteome-wide association study (PWAS), Mendelian randomization (MR), and colocalization (COLOC) analyses to identify the potentially causal brain and plasma proteins for IDPs, followed by pleiotropy analysis, mediation analysis, and drug exploration analysis to investigate potential mediation pathways of pleiotropic proteins to neuropsychiatric disorders (NDs) as well as candidate drug targets. A total of 201 plasma proteins and 398 brain proteins were significantly associated with IDPs from PWAS analysis. Subsequent MR and COLOC analyses further identified 313 potentially causal IDP-related proteins, which were significantly enriched in neural-related phenotypes, among which 91 were further identified as pleiotropic proteins associated with both IDPs and NDs, including EGFR, TMEM106B, GPT, and HLA-B. Drug prioritization analysis showed that 6.33% of unique pleiotropic proteins had drug targets or interactions with medications for NDs. Nine potential mediation pathways were identified to illustrate the mediating roles of the IDPs in the causal effect of the pleiotropic proteins on NDs, including the indirect effect of TMEM106B on Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk via radial diffusivity (RD) of the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC), with the mediation proportion being 11.18%, and the indirect effect of EGFR on AD through RD of PLIC, RD of splenium of corpus callosum (SCC), and fractional anisotropy (FA) of SCC, with the mediation proportion being 18.99%, 22.79%, and 19.91%, respectively. These findings provide novel insights into pathogenesis, drug targets, and neuroimaging biomarkers of NDs",PubMed
CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing: Curing Genetic Diseases by Inherited Epigenetic Modifications,"Introduction  CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, leveraging bacterial defense mechanisms, offers precise DNA modifications, holding promise in curing genetic diseases. This review critically assesses its potential, analyzing evidence on therapeutic applications, challenges, and future prospects. Examining diverse genetic disorders, it evaluates efficacy, safety, and limitations, emphasizing the need for a thorough understanding among medical professionals and researchers. Acknowledging its transformative impact, a systematic review is crucial for informed decision-making, responsible utilization, and guiding future research to unlock CRISPR-Cas9's full potential in realizing the cure for genetic diseases. Methods  A comprehensive literature search across PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science identified studies applying CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing for genetic diseases, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Inclusion criteria covered in vitro and in vivo models targeting various genetic diseases with reported outcomes on disease modification or potential cure. Quality assessment revealed a generally moderate to high risk of bias. Heterogeneity prevented quantitative meta-analysis, prompting a narrative synthesis of findings. Discussion  CRISPR-Cas9 enables precise gene editing, correcting disease-causing mutations and offering hope for previously incurable genetic conditions. Leveraging inherited epigenetic modifications, it not only fixes mutations but also restores normal gene function and controls gene expression. The transformative potential of CRISPR-Cas9 holds promise for personalized treatments, improving therapeutic outcomes, but ethical considerations and safety concerns must be rigorously addressed to ensure responsible and safe application, especially in germline editing with potential long-term implications",PubMed
Engineering Streptomyces sp. CPCC 204095 for the targeted high-level production of isatropolone A by elucidating its pathway-specific regulatory mechanism,"Isatropolone A and C, produced by Streptomyces sp. CPCC 204095, belong to an unusual class of non-benzenoid aromatic compounds and contain a rare seven-membered ring structure. Isatropolone A exhibits potent activity against Leishmania donovani, comparable to the only oral drug miltefosine. However, its variably low productivity represents a limitation for this lead compound in the future development of new anti-leishmaniasis drugs to meet unmet clinical needs. Here we first elucidated the regulatory cascade of biosynthesis of isatropolones, which consists of two SARP family regulators, IsaF and IsaJ. Through a series of in vivo and in vitro experiments, IsaF was identified as a pathway-specific activator that orchestrates the transcription of the gene cluster essential for isatropolone biosynthesis. Interestingly, IsaJ was found to only upregulate the expression of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase IsaS, which is crucial for the yield and proportion of isatropolone A and C. Through targeted gene deletions of isaJ or isaS, we effectively impeded the conversion of isatropolone A to C. Concurrently, the facilitation of isaF overexpression governed by selected promoters, prompted the comprehensive activation of the production of isatropolone A. Furthermore, meticulous optimization of the fermentation parameters was conducted. These strategies culminated in the attainment of an unprecedented maximum yield-980.8 mg/L of isatropolone A-achieved in small-scale solid-state fermentation utilizing the genetically modified strains, thereby establishing the highest reported titer to date. In Streptomyces sp. CPCC 204095, the production of isatropolone A and C is modulated by the SARP regulators IsaF and IsaJ. IsaF serves as a master pathway-specific regulator for the production of isatropolones. IsaJ, on the other hand, only dictates the transcription of IsaS, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of isatropolone A and C. By engineering the expression of these pivotal genes, we have devised a strategy for genetic modification aimed at the selective and high-yield biosynthesis of isatropolone A. This study not only unveils the unique regulatory mechanisms governing isatropolone biosynthesis for the first time, but also establishes an essential engineering framework for the targeted high-level production of isatropolone A",PubMed
Transposon mutagenesis screen in Klebsiella pneumoniae identifies genetic determinants required for growth in human urine and serum,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is a global public health concern due to the rising myriad of hypervirulent and multi-drug resistant clones both alarmingly associated with high mortality. The molecular microbial genetics underpinning these recalcitrant K. pneumoniae infections is unclear, coupled with the emergence of lineages resistant to nearly all present day clinically important antimicrobials. In this study, we performed a genome-wide screen in K. pneumoniae ECL8, a member of the endemic K2-ST375 pathotype most often reported in Asia, to define genes essential for growth in a nutrient-rich laboratory medium (Luria-Bertani medium), human urine and serum. Through transposon directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS), a total of 427 genes were identified as essential for growth on LB agar, whereas transposon insertions in 11 and 144 genes decreased fitness for growth in either urine or serum, respectively. These studies provide further knowledge on the genetics of this pathogen but also provide a strong impetus for discovering new antimicrobial targets to improve current therapeutic options for K. pneumoniae infections",biorxiv
Leber hereditary optic neuropathy in Slovenia: quality of life and costs from patient perspective,"Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is the most commonly diagnosed mitochondrial disorder, resulting in colour vision abnormalities and rapid but painless deterioration of central vision. While numerous studies have assessed the impact of LHON on the quality of life (QoL) of LHON patients, the financial impact of the disease remains unexplored. This study attempts to calculate both the direct non-medical costs and the indirect costs associated with productivity losses experienced by people with LHON and their unpaid caregivers in Slovenia, in addition to assessing their QoL. Due to the rarity of the disease, the study involved a small sample size, which is important to note for interpreting the results. The analysis was conducted on nine adult participants diagnosed with LHON, representing one-third of the total number of known Slovenian patients with this condition. To thoroughly assess the economic and social impact of LHON, tailored questionnaires were designed to collect information on demographics, socioeconomic status, LHON severity, and associated non-medical and indirect costs. The mean age of the study participants was 48.8 years (SD 13.3; n = 9). The annual productivity loss attributable to LHON, taking both absenteeism and relative presenteeism into account, was calculated to be EUR 11,608 per person affected. The mean VFQ-25 score, a measure of vision-related quality of life, for adult LHON patients was 30.4 (SD 12.9). The findings highlight the significant economic and social burden of LHON on patients and their families. Ensuring prompt, accurate diagnosis, access to treatment, financial support, and psychological counselling and services are critical to helping individuals cope with and mitigate the profound challenges of vision loss and living with LHON",PubMed
A complex mechanism translating variation of a simple genetic architecture into alternative life-histories,"Linking genes to traits is a central goal in biology. Despite progress in discovering genes associated with trait differences, a poor understanding of the functional mechanisms underlying genetic associations leaves us critically far from connecting genetic and phenotypic variation. This knowledge-gap is particularly large in multifaceted phenotypes of ecological relevance such as life-history traits. Using a multiomic dissection of the genotype-phenotype association in a large-effect maturation age gene - the transcription cofactor vestigial-like 3 (vgll3) - in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), we show that vgll3 mediates concerted changes of distinct molecular phenotypes associated with puberty in male gonads. Vgll3 genotype conferring early maturity upregulates key genes controlling androgen production, cellular energy and adiposity, and TGF-{beta} signaling, among others, thereby increasing the likelihood of earlier pubertal initiation. Genotype-dependent developmental trajectories are produced through VGLL3 interaction with distinct transcription factors, thus coordinating differential activation of regulatory pathways. These results reveal a genetically simple, yet functionally complex, architecture underlying alternative life-histories where variation in a single major effect gene produces pleiotropic variation in a spectrum of cellular traits. Our results further suggest that evolution in correlated phenotypes such as exemplified by alternative life history strategies may be mediated by a surprisingly simple genetic architecture",biorxiv
The ivory lncRNA regulates seasonal color patterns in buckeye butterflies,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcribed elements increasingly recognized for their roles in regulating gene expression. Thus far, however, we have little understanding of how lncRNAs contribute to evolution and adaptation. Here we show that a conserved lncRNA, ivory, is an important color patterning gene in the buckeye butterfly Junonia coenia. ivory overlaps with cortex, a locus linked to multiple cases of crypsis and mimicry in Lepidoptera. Along with a companion paper by Livraghi et. al., we argue that ivory, not cortex, is the color pattern gene of interest at this locus. In J. coenia a cluster of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in the first intron of ivory are genetically associated with natural variation in seasonal color pattern plasticity, and targeted deletions of these CREs phenocopy seasonal phenotypes. Deletions of different ivory CREs produce other distinct phenotypes as well, including loss of melanic eyespot rings, and positive and negative changes in overall wing pigmentation. We show that the color pattern transcription factors Spineless, Bric-a-brac, and Ftz-f1 bind to the ivory promoter during wing pattern development, suggesting that they directly regulate ivory. This case study demonstrates how cis-regulation of a single non-coding RNA can exert diverse and nuanced effects on the evolution and development of color patterns, including modulating seasonally plastic color patterns.  SignificanceThe genomic locus hosting the cortex gene has been linked to numerous cases of color pattern adaptation in moths and butterflies, including crypsis, mimicry, and seasonal polyphenism. Here we show in buckeye butterflies that the actual color pattern gene at the cortex locus is an evolutionarily conserved long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), dubbed ivory, that overlaps with cortex. Compared with other wing pattern genes, ivory stands out because of the highly nuanced, quantitative changes in pigmentation that can be achieved by manipulating adjacent cis-regulatory sequences. This study highlights how lncRNAs can be important factors underlying morphological evolution, and emphasizes the importance of considering non-coding transcripts in comparative genomics",biorxiv
Human Leukocyte Antigen-Allelic Variations May Influence the Age at Cancer Diagnosis in Lynch Syndrome,"Lynch syndrome (LS) is an inherited cancer predisposition disorder associated with an elevated risk of developing various solid cancers, but mostly colorectal cancer (CRC). Despite having the same germline pathogenic variant (PV) in one of the mis-match repair genes or the EPCAM gene, Lynch syndrome variant heterozygotes (LSVH) exhibit a remarkable phenotypic variability in the risk of developing cancer. The role of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in modifying cancer development risk prompted our hypothesis into whether HLA variations act as potential genetic modifiers influencing the age at cancer diagnosis in LSVH. To investigate this, we studied a unique cohort of 426 LSVH carrying the same germline PV in the hMLH1 gene (MLH1:c.1528C > T) in South Africa. We intuitively selected 100 LSVH with the greatest diversity in age at cancer diagnosis (N = 80) and the oldest cancer unaffected LSVH (N = 20) for a high-throughput HLA genotyping of 11 HLA class I and class II loci using the shotgun next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Statistical analyses employed Kaplan-Meier survival analyses with log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards using binned HLA data to minimize type I error. Significant associations were observed between young age at cancer diagnosis and HLA-DPB1*04:02 (mean age: 37 y (25-50); hazard ratio (HR) = 3.37; corrected p-value (q) = 0.043) as well as HLA-DPB1 binned alleles (including HLA-DPB1*09:01, HLA-DPB1*10:01, HLA-DPB1*106:01, HLA-DPB1*18:01, HLA-DPB1*20:01, HLA-DPB1*26:01, HLA-DPB1*28:01, HLA-DPB1*296:01, and HLA-DPB1*55:01) (mean age: 37 y (17-63); HR = 2.30, q = 0.045). The involvement of HLA-DPB1 alleles in the age at cancer diagnosis may highlight the potential role of HLA class II in the immune response against cancer development in LSVH. When validated in a larger cohort, these high-risk HLA-DPB1 alleles could be factored into cancer risk prediction models for personalized cancer screening in LSVH",PubMed
The Metabolic Role of MAP3K15: Genetic and Phenotypic Insights from the 23andMe Research Database and Genetics-Driven Recruitment,"MAP3K15 has been previously associated with protection from type 2 diabetes (T2D), prompting interest in the development of MAP3K15 inhibitors as a potential therapeutic option for diabetes. The trans-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis and loss-of-function (LoF) burden testing methods that implicate association with T2D greatly benefit from large sample size. The direct-to-consumer genetic testing company, 23andMe, Inc., is the worlds largest research consented genetic database. We leveraged the 23andMe database to further inform the metabolic role of MAP3K15, using a variety of genetic analysis methods. We find that MAP3K15 LoF carriers show a significant delay of 4.5 years in the median age of T2D diagnosis among individuals at high polygenic risk and uncover a novel burden association of MAP3K15 LoF with protection against high cholesterol. We expanded these findings by establishing a capability to recruit consented participants on the basis of genetics unknown to them (specifically, a single LoF variant in MAP3K15, rs148312150), and obtained clinical laboratory evidence of a modest reduction in median cholesterol and LDL/HDL ratio in MAP3K15 LoF carriers. Our findings demonstrate the discovery power of the 23andMe database, including the feasibility of consented participant recruitment to inform therapeutic discovery and development",medrxiv
Sperm epigenetics and sperm RNAs as drivers of male infertility: truth or myth?,"Male infertility represents a complex clinical condition that often challenges the ability of reproductive specialists to find its etiology and then propose an adequate treatment. The unexplained decline in sperm count, as well as the association between male infertility and mortality, morbidity, and cancer, has prompted researchers toward an urgent need to better understand the causes of male infertility. Therefore, molecular biologists are increasingly trying to study whether sperm epigenetic alterations may be involved in male infertility and embryo developmental abnormalities. In this context, research is also trying to uncover the hidden role of sperm RNAs, both coding and non-coding. This narrative review aims to thoroughly and comprehensively present the relationship between sperm epigenetics, sperm RNAs, and human fertility. We first focused on the technological aspects of studying sperm epigenetics and RNAs, relating to the complex role(s) played in sperm maturation, fertilization, and embryo development. Then, we examined the intricate connections between epigenetics and RNAs with fertility measures, namely sperm concentration, embryo growth and development, and live birth rate, in both animal and human studies. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in sperm epigenetic regulation, as well as the impact of RNA players, will help to tackle infertility",PubMed
Genetic factors associated with reasons for clinical trial stoppage,"Many drug discovery projects are started but few progress fully through clinical trials to approval. Previous work has shown that human genetics support for the therapeutic hypothesis increases the chance of trial progression. Here, we applied natural language processing to classify the free-text reasons for 28,561 clinical trials that stopped before their endpoints were met. We then evaluated these classes in light of the underlying evidence for the therapeutic hypothesis and target properties. We found that trials are more likely to stop because of a lack of efficacy in the absence of strong genetic evidence from human populations or genetically modified animal models. Furthermore, certain trials are more likely to stop for safety reasons if the drug target gene is highly constrained in human populations and if the gene is broadly expressed across tissues. These results support the growing use of human genetics to evaluate targets for drug discovery programs",PubMed

Management of aortic disease in children with FBN1-related Marfan syndrome,"Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a hereditary connective tissue disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1:5000-1:10 000 individuals. It is a pleiotropic disease characterized by specific ocular, cardiovascular, and skeletal features. The most common cardiovascular complication is aortic root dilatation which untreated can lead to life-threatening aortic root dissection, mainly occurring in adult patients. Prompt diagnosis, appropriate follow-up, and timely treatment can prevent aortic events. Currently there are no specific recommendations for treatment of children with MFS, and management is greatly based on adult guidelines. Furthermore, due to the scarcity of studies including children, there is a lack of uniform treatment across different centres. This consensus document aims at bridging these gaps of knowledge. This work is a joint collaboration between the paediatric subgroup of the European Network of Vascular Diseases (VASCERN, Heritable Thoracic Aortic Disease Working Group) and the Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology (AEPC). A group of experts from 12 different centres and 8 different countries participated in this effort.

We herein report a unique case of medullary thyroid carcinoma in a 50-year-old male who presented with a neck mass. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the thyroid and histopathological examination revealed a diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma.

Renal Replacement Therapy in Methylmalonic Aciduria-Related Metabolic Failure: Case Report and Literature Review,"Methylmalonic Aciduria (MA) without homocystinuria (or isolated MA) is a group of rare inherited metabolic disorders which leads to the accumulation of methylmalonic acid (MMA), a toxic molecule that accumulates in blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid, causing acute and chronic complications including metabolic crises, acute kidney injury (AKI), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Detailed Case Description: Herein, we report a case of a 39-year-old male with MA and stage IV CKD who experienced acute metabolic decompensation secondary to gastrointestinal infection. The patient underwent a single hemodialysis (HD) session to correct severe metabolic acidosis unresponsive to medical therapy and to rapidly remove MMA. The HD session resulted in prompt clinical improvement and shortening of hospitalization. MMA accumulation in MA patients causes acute and life-threatening complications, such as metabolic decompensations, and long-term complications such as CKD, eventually leading to renal replacement therapy (RRT). Data reported in the literature show that, overall, all dialytic treatments (intermittent HD, continuous HD, peritoneal dialysis) are effective in MMA removal. HD, in particular, can be useful in the emergency setting to control metabolic crises, even with GFR > 15 mL/min. Kidney and/or liver transplantations are often needed in MA patients. While a solitary transplanted kidney can be rapidly affected by MMA exposure, with a decline in renal function even in the first year of follow-up, the combined liver-kidney transplantation showed better long-term results due to a combination of reduced MMA production along with increased urinary excretion. Early diagnosis, multidisciplinary management and preventive measures are pivotal in MA patients to avoid recurrent AKI episodes and, consequently, to slow down CKD progression",PubMed
"Mcph1, mutated in primary microcephaly, is also crucial for erythropoiesis","Microcephaly is a common feature in inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, prompting investigations into shared pathways between neurogenesis and hematopoiesis. To understand this association, we studied the role of the microcephaly gene Mcph1 in hematological development. Our research revealed that Mcph1-knockout mice exhibited congenital macrocytic anemia due to impaired terminal erythroid differentiation during fetal development. Anemia's cause is a failure to complete cell division, evident from tetraploid erythroid progenitors with DNA content exceeding 4n. Gene expression profiling demonstrated activation of the p53 pathway in Mcph1-deficient erythroid precursors, leading to overexpression of Cdkn1a/p21, a major mediator of p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. Surprisingly, fetal brain analysis revealed hypertrophied binucleated neuroprogenitors overexpressing p21 in Mcph1-knockout mice, indicating a shared pathophysiological mechanism underlying both erythroid and neurological defects. However, inactivating p53 in Mcph1<sup>-/-</sup> mice failed to reverse anemia and microcephaly, suggesting that p53 activation in Mcph1-deficient cells resulted from their proliferation defect rather than causing it. These findings shed new light on Mcph1's function in fetal hematopoietic development, emphasizing the impact of disrupted cell division on neurogenesis and erythropoiesis - a common limiting pathway",PubMed
"Nix coordinates nuclear calcium signaling to modulate the muscle phenotype
==========
The mitophagy receptor Nix coordinates nuclear calcium signaling to modulate the muscle phenotype","Mitochondrial quality control is critical in muscle to ensure both contractile and metabolic function. Nix is a BCL-2 family member, selective autophagy receptor, and has recently been implicated in muscle atrophy. Human GWAS suggests altered Nix expression could predispose individuals to manifestations of mitochondrial disease. To interrogate the biological role of Nix, we generated a muscle-specific knockout model. Nix knockout mice displayed a ragged-red fibre phenotype, along with accumulation of mitochondria and endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum with altered morphology. Intriguingly, Nix knockout mice were more insulin sensitive with a corresponding increase in glycogen-rich muscle fibres. Kinome- and gene expression analyses revealed that Nix knockout impairs NFAT and canonical myostatin signaling, with alterations in muscle fibre-type composition and evidence of regeneration. Mechanistic experiments demonstrated that Nix modulates mitophagy, along with ER-phagy leading to altered nuclear calcium signaling. Collectively, these observations identify novel roles for Nix coordinating selective autophagy, oxidative gene expression, and signaling pathways that maintain tissue integrity.  HighlightsO_LIRemoval of Nix in muscle results in a compensated mitochondrial myopathy C_LIO_LINix knockout alters cell signaling and oxidative gene expression C_LIO_LINix also modulates myostatin expression and Smad signaling C_LIO_LINix knockout alters muscle fibre-type distribution and muscle function C_LI  SignificanceHow mitochondria respond to cell stress to activate cell signaling pathways remains poorly understood. We show that genetic removal of the selective autophagy receptor Nix from muscle leads to alterations in cell signaling and the muscle phenotype. These observations help explain how selective autophagy pathways can modulate tissue homeostasis during metabolic stress",biorxiv
BioMedLM: A 2.7B Parameter Language Model Trained On Biomedical Text,"Models such as GPT-4 and Med-PaLM 2 have demonstrated impressive performance on a wide variety of biomedical NLP tasks. However, these models have hundreds of billions of parameters, are computationally expensive to run, require users to send their input data over the internet, and are trained on unknown data sources. Can smaller, more targeted models compete? To address this question, we build and release BioMedLM, a 2.7 billion parameter GPT-style autoregressive model trained exclusively on PubMed abstracts and full articles. When fine-tuned, BioMedLM can produce strong multiple-choice biomedical question-answering results competitive with much larger models, such as achieving a score of 57.3% on MedMCQA (dev) and 69.0% on the MMLU Medical Genetics exam. BioMedLM can also be fine-tuned to produce useful answers to patient questions on medical topics. This demonstrates that smaller models can potentially serve as transparent, privacy-preserving, economical and environmentally friendly foundations for particular NLP applications, such as in biomedicine. The model is available on the Hugging Face Hub: https://huggingface.co/stanford-crfm/BioMedLM",arXiv
Histone serotonylation in dorsal raphe nucleus contributes to stress- and antidepressant-mediated gene expression and behavior,"Mood disorders are an enigmatic class of debilitating illnesses that affect millions of individuals worldwide. While chronic stress clearly increases incidence levels of mood disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), stress-mediated disruptions in brain function that precipitate these illnesses remain largely elusive. Serotonin-associated antidepressants (ADs) remain the first line of therapy for many with depressive symptoms, yet low remission rates and delays between treatment and symptomatic alleviation have prompted skepticism regarding direct roles for serotonin in the precipitation and treatment of affective disorders. Our group recently demonstrated that serotonin epigenetically modifies histone proteins (H3K4me3Q5ser) to regulate transcriptional permissiveness in brain. However, this non-canonical phenomenon has not yet been explored following stress and/or AD exposures. Here, we employed a combination of genome-wide and biochemical analyses in dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of male and female mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress, as well as in DRN of human MDD patients, to examine the impact of stress exposures/MDD diagnosis on H3K4me3Q5ser dynamics, as well as associations between the mark and depression-related gene expression. We additionally assessed stress-induced/MDD-associated regulation of H3K4me3Q5ser following AD exposures, and employed viral-mediated gene therapy in mice to reduce H3K4me3Q5ser levels in DRN and examine its impact on stress-associated gene expression and behavior. We found that H3K4me3Q5ser plays important roles in stress-mediated transcriptional plasticity. Chronically stressed mice displayed dysregulated H3K4me3Q5ser dynamics in DRN, with both AD- and viral-mediated disruption of these dynamics proving sufficient to attenuate stress-mediated gene expression and behavior. Corresponding patterns of H3K4me3Q5ser regulation were observed in MDD subjects on vs. off ADs at their time of death. These findings thus establish a neurotransmission-independent role for serotonin in stress-/AD-associated transcriptional and behavioral plasticity, observations of which may be of clinical relevance to human MDD and its treatment",PubMed
Patterns and unique features of infantile cholestasis among Arabs,"Most of the literature on infantile cholestasis (IC) originated from Caucasian and Asian populations. The differential diagnosis of IC is very broad, and identification of etiology is challenging to clinicians because the list includes many entities with overlapping clinical, biochemical, and histological features. Thus, a structured, stepwise diagnostic approach is required to help early recognition and prompt evaluation and management of treatable causes of cholestasis. (1) To determine the differential diagnosis of IC among Saudi population and (2) to evaluate the usefulness of a diagnostic algorithm that has been tailored by the authors to the local practice. All infants with onset of cholestasis before 12 months of age (2007 and 2020) were identified and included if they underwent extensive work up to exclude infectious, structural, metabolic, endocrine, infiltrative, and familial causes. Our diagnostic pathway allowed a definite diagnosis in 373 of the included 533 cases; 160 (30%) were labelled as ""idiopathic neonatal hepatitis"" (INH) [i.e., overall 70% detection rate]. However, when considering the cases that underwent extensive investigations including advanced gene testing (415 of the 533), the yield of the diagnostic algorithm was 90% (373/415). Familial cholestasis group was the most common in 20% (107/533), and biliary atresia and neonatal-onset Dubin Johnson syndrome contributed to 6% each. The genetic/hereditary causes of cholestasis contributed to 58% of the diagnosed cases (217/373). No single case of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency was diagnosed. Forty-nine infants with cholestasis presented with liver failure (9%). Our study highlights several unique features and causes of IC among Arabs which could have a great impact on the differential diagnosis process and the choice of laboratory tests used in the clinical setting",PubMed
SAP: Synteny-aware gene function prediction for bacteria using protein embeddings,"MotivationToday, we know the function of only a small fraction of the protein sequences predicted from genomic data. This problem is even more salient for bacteria, which represent some of the most phylogenetically and metabolically diverse taxa on Earth. This low rate of bacterial gene annotation is compounded by the fact that most function prediction algorithms have focused on eukaryotes, and conventional annotation approaches rely on the presence of similar sequences in existing databases. However, often there are no such sequences for novel bacterial proteins. Thus, we need improved gene function prediction methods tailored for prokaryotes. Recently, transformer-based language models - adopted from the natural language processing field - have been used to obtain new representations of proteins, to replace amino acid sequences. These representations, referred to as protein embeddings, have shown promise for improving annotation of eukaryotes, but there have been only limited applications on bacterial genomes.  ResultsTo predict gene functions in bacteria, we developed SAP, a novel synteny-aware gene function prediction tool based on protein embeddings from state-of-the-art protein language models. SAP also leverages the unique operon structure of bacteria through conserved synteny. SAP outperformed both conventional sequence-based annotation methods and state-of-the-art methods on multiple bacterial species, including for distant homolog detection, where the sequence similarity to the proteins in the training set was as low as 40%. Using SAP to identify gene functions across diverse enterococci, of which some species are major clinical threats, we identified 11 previously unrecognized putative novel toxins, with potential significance to human and animal health.

"Prioritizing genomic variants through neuro-symbolic, knowledge-enhanced learning","MotivationWhole-exome and genome sequencing have become common tools in diagnosing patients with rare diseases. Despite their success, this approach leaves many patients undiagnosed. A common argument is that more disease variants still await discovery, or the novelty of disease phenotypes results from a combination of variants in multiple disease-related genes. Interpreting the phenotypic consequences of genomic variants relies on information about gene functions, gene expression, physiology, and other genomic features. Phenotype-based methods to identify variants involved in genetic diseases combine molecular features with prior knowledge about the phenotypic consequences of altering gene functions. While phenotype-based methods have been successfully applied to prioritizing variants, such methods are based on known gene-disease or gene-phenotype associations as training data and are applicable to genes that have phenotypes associated, thereby limiting their scope. In addition, phenotypes are not assigned uniformly by different clinicians, and phenotype-based methods need to account for this variability.  ResultsWe developed an Embedding-based Phenotype Variant Predictor (EmbedPVP), a computational method to prioritize variants involved in genetic diseases by combining genomic information and clinical phenotypes. EmbedPVP leverages a large amount of background knowledge from human and model organisms about molecular mechanisms through which abnormal phenotypes may arise. Specifically, EmbedPVP incorporates phenotypes linked to genes, functions of gene products, and the anatomical site of gene expression, and systematically relates them to their phenotypic effects through neuro-symbolic, knowledge-enhanced machine learning. We demonstrate EmbedPVPs efficacy on a large set of synthetic genomes and genomes matched with clinical information.

Integrated analyses of single-cell transcriptome and Mendelian randomization reveal the protective role of FCRL3 in multiple sclerosis,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) represents a multifaceted autoimmune ailment, prompting the development and widespread utilization of numerous therapeutic interventions. However, extant medications for MS have proven inadequate in mitigating relapses and halting disease progression. Innovative drug targets for preventing multiple sclerosis are still required. The objective of this study is to discover novel therapeutic targets for MS by integrating single-cell transcriptomics and Mendelian randomization analysis. The study integrated MS genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) data for analysis and utilized two-sample Mendelian randomization study to comprehend the causal relationship between proteins and MS. Sequential analyses involving colocalization and Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) were conducted to validate the causal role of candidate genes. Following stringent quality control preprocessing of scRNA-seq data, 1,123 expression changes across seven peripheral cell types were identified. Among the seven most prevalent cell types, 97 genes exhibiting at least one eQTL were discerned. Examination of MR associations between 28 proteins with available index pQTL signals and the risk of MS outcomes was conducted. Co-localization analyses and PheWAS indicated that FCRL3 may exert influence on MS. The integration of scRNA-seq and MR analysis facilitated the identification of potential therapeutic targets for MS. Notably, FCRL3, implicated in immune function, emerged as a significant drug target in the deCODE databases. This research underscores the importance of FCRL3 in MS therapy and advocates for further investigation and clinical trials targeting FCRL3",PubMed
Systems Modeling Reveals Shared Metabolic Dysregulation and Novel Therapeutic Treatments in ME/CFS and Long COVID,"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Long COVID are complex, multisystemic conditions that pose ongoing challenges to healthcare professionals. Emerging research suggests that ME/CFS and Long COVID exhibit overlapping metabolic symptoms, indicating possible shared metabolic dysfunctions. This study aims to systematically explore these shared metabolic disturbances and their potential treatments. Utilizing our novel metabolic modeling method, GPMM, we identified the key metabolic irregularities in patients with ME/CFS and Long COVID, notably the downregulation of the alanine and aspartate metabolism pathway, and the arginine and proline metabolism pathway. Genome-wide knockout analyses indicated that supplementation with aspartate (ASP) or asparagine (ASN) could potentially ameliorate these metabolic deficiencies. Further metabolic assessments in Long COVID patients highlighted the significant downregulation of ASP in both blood and muscle, supporting our predictions. Consequently, we propose that the combination of l-ornithine and l-aspartate (LOLA) offers a promising approach to alleviate metabolic symptoms in both ME/CFS and Long COVID patients. This study not only elucidates the shared metabolic pathways in ME/CFS and Long COVID but also positions LOLA as a viable candidate for future clinical trials",biorxiv
Natural Language Processing in medicine and ophthalmology: A review for the 21st-century clinician,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language, enabling computers to understand, generate, and derive meaning from human language. NLP's potential applications in the medical field are extensive and vary from extracting data from Electronic Health Records -one of its most well-known and frequently exploited uses- to investigating relationships among genetics, biomarkers, drugs, and diseases for the proposal of new medications. NLP can be useful for clinical decision support, patient monitoring, or medical image analysis. Despite its vast potential, the real-world application of NLP is still limited due to various challenges and constraints, meaning that its evolution predominantly continues within the research domain. However, with the increasingly widespread use of NLP, particularly with the availability of large language models, such as ChatGPT, it is crucial for medical professionals to be aware of the status, uses, and limitations of these technologies",PubMed
Treatment of Netherton Syndrome in Pediatrics with Upadacitinib,"Netherton syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disease, lacks effective treatment options. This article presents a novel case of successful Upadacitinib therapy in a 14-year-old boy with Netherton syndrome. A 14-year-old male with a lifelong history of dry skin, erythema, scaling, itching, and notable body odor was evaluated. These symptoms, accompanied by irregular hair growth and delayed development, prompted an initial diagnosis of atopic dermatitis at a local hospital. Treatment with antihistamines, moisturizers, and topical corticosteroids failed to alleviate systemic manifestations of red patches and persistent itching. Seeking further evaluation, the patient was presented to our center. Upon examination, the characteristics of ""bamboo hair"" and ""golf tee sign"" were observed microscopically in the patient's hair. Whole exome sequencing identified a paternally inherited mutation in the SPINK5 gene, confirming Netherton syndrome. No mutations were found in the mother. Despite initial positive responses to Secukinumab and Dupilumab, therapeutic efficacy waned over time. Initiation of Upadacitinib at a daily dose of 15 mg yielded significant therapeutic benefits within a short timeframe. This study marks the first documented use of Upadacitinib in pediatric Netherton syndrome treatment. This case highlights the efficacy of Upadacitinib in treating Netherton syndrome, particularly in pediatric patients. Further studies are warranted to elucidate its long-term effects and optimal dosing regimens",PubMed
A case of malignant pheochromocytoma with neurofibromatosis type 1 having difficulty in differentiating spinal tumor,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a hereditary condition often associated with pheochromocytomas but rarely with malignant pheochromocytomas. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is often associated with bone lesions, which complicates the distinction between malignant and benign tumors. A 46-year-old man with a medical history of neurofibromatosis type 1 presented with right abdominal pain. Computed tomography revealed a right adrenal tumor, and metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy showed accumulation in the right adrenal gland and thoracic vertebrae. He was diagnosed with pheochromocytoma, and a right adrenalectomy was performed. After surgery, a bone biopsy was conducted on the spinal lesion, confirming metastasis of pheochromocytoma, prompting irradiation. After that, lung and liver metastases emerged, and chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine was initiated; however, the disease progressed, and he died 11 months after surgery. We report a case of malignant pheochromocytoma associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 in which bone metastasis was difficult to diagnose",PubMed
Genotype-Phenotype Correlations in Chronic Granulomatous Disease: Insights From a Large National Cohort,"Neutrophils are the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Neutrophils execute and modulate immune responses by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is a primary immune deficiency disorder of phagocytes, caused by inherited mutations in the genes of the NADPH oxidase enzyme. These mutations lead to failure of ROS generation followed by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, frequently associated with hyper-inflammatory manifestations. We report a multi-center cumulative experience in diagnosing and treating patients with CGD. From 1986 to 2021, 2,918 patients suffering from frequent infections were referred for neutrophil evaluation. Among them, 110 patients were diagnosed with CGD, 56 of Jewish ancestry, 48 of Arabic ancestry and 6 non-Jewish/non-Arabic. As opposed to other Western countries, the autosomal recessive (AR) CGD subtypes were predominant in Israel (71/110 patients). Thirty-nine patients had X-linked CGD, in most patients associated with severe infections (clinical severity score ≥3) and poor outcomes, presenting at a significantly earlier age than AR-CGD subtypes. The full spectrum of infections and hyper-inflammatory manifestations are described. Six patients had hypomorphic mutations with significantly milder phenotype, clinical severity score ≤2, and better outcomes. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was implemented in 39/110 patients (35.5%). Successful engraftment was achieved in 92%, with 82% long-term survival and 71% full clinical recovery. CGD is a complex disorder requiring a multi-professional team. Early identification of the genetic mutation is essential for prompt diagnosis, suitable management and prevention",PubMed
SciConNav: Knowledge navigation through contextual learning of extensive scientific research trajectories,"New knowledge builds upon existing foundations, which means an interdependent relationship exists between knowledge, manifested in the historical development of the scientific system for hundreds of years. By leveraging natural language processing techniques, this study introduces the Scientific Concept Navigator (SciConNav), an embedding-based navigation model to infer the ""knowledge pathway"" from the research trajectories of millions of scholars. We validate that the learned representations effectively delineate disciplinary boundaries and capture the intricate relationships between diverse concepts. The utility of the inferred navigation space is showcased through multiple applications. Firstly, we demonstrated the multi-step analogy inferences within the knowledge space and the interconnectivity between concepts in different disciplines. Secondly, we formulated the attribute dimensions of knowledge across domains, observing the distributional shifts in the arrangement of 19 disciplines along these conceptual dimensions, including ""Theoretical"" to ""Applied"", and ""Chemical"" to ""Biomedical', highlighting the evolution of functional attributes within knowledge domains. Lastly, by analyzing the high-dimensional knowledge network structure, we found that knowledge connects with shorter global pathways, and interdisciplinary knowledge plays a critical role in the accessibility of the global knowledge network. Our framework offers a novel approach to mining knowledge inheritance pathways in extensive scientific literature, which is of great significance for understanding scientific progression patterns, tailoring scientific learning trajectories, and accelerating scientific progress",arXiv
Fructose Induced KHK-C Increases ER Stress and Modulates Hepatic Transcriptome to Drive Liver Disease in Diet-Induced and Genetic Models of NAFLD,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a liver manifestation of metabolic syndrome, and is estimated to affect one billion individuals worldwide. An increased intake of a high-fat diet (HFD) and sugar-sweetened beverages are risk-factors for NAFLD development, but how their combined intake promotes progression to a more severe form of liver injury is unknown. Here we show that fructose metabolism via ketohexokinase (KHK) C isoform increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in a dose dependent fashion, so when fructose is coupled with a HFD intake it leads to unresolved ER stress. Conversely, a liver-specific knockdown of KHK in C57BL/6J male mice consuming fructose on a HFD is adequate to improve the NAFLD activity score and exert a profound effect on the hepatic transcriptome. Overexpression of KHK-C in cultured hepatocytes is sufficient to induce ER stress in fructose free media. Upregulation of KHK-C is also observed in genetically obesity ob/ob, db/db and lipodystrophic FIRKO male mice, whereas KHK knockdown in these mice improves metabolic function. Additionally, in over 100 inbred strains of male or female mice hepatic KHK expression correlates positively with adiposity, insulin resistance, and liver triglycerides. Similarly, in 241 human subjects and their controls, hepatic Khk expression is upregulated in early, but not late stages of NAFLD. In summary, we describe a novel role of KHK-C in triggering ER stress, which offers a mechanistic understanding of how the combined intake of fructose and a HFD propagates the development of metabolic complications",biorxiv
Unpacking Unstructured Data: A Pilot Study on Extracting Insights from Neuropathological Reports of Parkinson's Disease Patients using Large Language Models,"ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to make unstructured neuropathological data, located in the NeuroBioBank (NBB), follow FAIR principles, and investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in wrangling unstructured neuropathological reports. By making the currently inconsistent and disparate data findable, our overarching goal was to enhance research output and speed.  Materials and MethodsThe NBB catalog currently includes information from medical records, interview results, and neuropathological reports. These reports contain crucial information necessary for conducting in-depth analysis of NBB data but have multiple formats that vary across different NBB biorepositories and change over time. In this study we focused on a subset of 822 donors with Parkinsons disease (PD) from 7 NBB biorepositories. We developed a data model with combined Brain Region and Pathological Findings data at its core. This approach made it easier to build an extraction pipeline and was flexible enough to convert resulting data to Common Data Elements (CDEs), a standardized data collection tools used by the neuroscience community to improve consistency and facilitate data sharing across studies.  ResultsThis pilot study demonstrated the potential of LLMs in structuring unstructured neuropathological reports of PD patients available in the NBB. The pipeline enabled successful extraction of detailed tissue-level (microscopic) and gross anatomical (macroscopic) observations, along with staging information from pathology reports, with extraction quality comparable to manual curation results. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to automatically standardize neuropathological information at this scale. The collected data has the potential to serve as a valuable resource for PD researchers, facilitating integration with clinical information and genetic data (such as genome-wide genotyping and whole genome sequencing) available through the NBB, hereby enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the disease",biorxiv
Cellular contributions to ictal population signals,"ObjectiveThe amplitude of ictal activity is a defining feature of epileptic seizures, but the determinants of this amplitude have not been identified. Clinically, ictal amplitudes are measured electrographically (using e.g. EEG, ECoG, and depth electrodes), but these methods do not enable the assessment of the activity of individual neurons. To identify the cellular determinants of the ictal signal, we measured single cell and population electrical activity and neuronal calcium levels via optical imaging of the genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) GCaMP.  MethodsSpontaneous seizure activity was assessed in an awake, behaving mouse model of focal cortical injury and in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSC), an in vitro preparation from which recurrent seizures can be readily captured. Single cell calcium signals were linked to a range of electrical activities by performing simultaneous GECI-based calcium imaging and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in spontaneously seizing OHSCs. Neuronal resolution calcium imaging was then performed during spontaneous seizures in vivo and in vitro to quantify the cellular contributions to the population-level calcium signal.  ResultsPopulation signal may increase from three potential sources: 1) increased synchrony, i.e. more co-active neurons, 2) altered active state, from bursts of action potentials and/or paroxysmal depolarizing shifts in membrane potential, and 3) altered subthreshold state, which includes all lower levels of activity. The largest contributor to the signal recorded at seizure onset was increased subthreshold activity, consistent with either barrages of excitatory postsynaptic potentials or sustained membrane depolarization. The relative contribution of synchrony increased as seizures progressed, but cell intrinsic alterations in both the subthreshold and active states remained the largest driver of the ictal signal.  SignificanceWe introduce here a novel method for the quantification of the relative contributions of inter-versus intra-cellular changes to provide a critical link between single neuron activity and population measures of seizure activity.  Key PointsO_LINeuronal calcium as measured by GCaMP reports a range of membrane depolarizations, from EPSPs to action potential firing and paroxysmal depolarizing shifts C_LIO_LIThe mean population calcium signal is highly correlated with the electrographic local field potential C_LIO_LIIncreased calcium signal during seizure onset is largely driven by increased subthreshold calcium within individual neurons C_LIO_LIRecruitment of newly active neurons is a minor contributor to the increasing population-level signal during the transition to frank seizure C_LI",biorxiv
Empowering Personalized Pharmacogenomics with Generative AI Solutions,"ObjectiveThis study evaluates an AI assistant developed using OpenAIs GPT-4 for interpreting pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing results, aiming to improve decision-making and knowledge sharing in clinical genetics, and to enhance patient care with equitable access.  MethodsThe AI assistant employs Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combining retrieval and generative techniques. It employs a Knowledge Base (KB) comprising Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) data, with context-aware GPT-4 generating tailored responses to user queries from this KB, refined through prompt engineering and guardrails.  ResultsEvaluated against a specialized PGx question catalog, the AI assistant showed high efficacy in addressing user queries. Compared with OpenAIs ChatGPT 3.5, it demonstrated better performance, especially in provider-specific queries requiring specialized data and citations. Key areas for improvement include enhancing accuracy, relevancy, and representative language in responses.  DiscussionThe integration of context-aware GPT-4 with RAG significantly enhanced the AI assistants utility. RAGs ability to incorporate domain-specific CPIC data, including recent literature, proved beneficial. Challenges persist, such as the need for specialized genetic/PGx models to improve accuracy and relevancy and addressing ethical, regulatory, and safety concerns.  ConclusionThis study underscores generative AIs potential for transforming healthcare provider support and patient accessibility to complex pharmacogenomic information. While careful implementation of large language models like GPT-4 is necessary, it is clear that they can substantially improve understanding of pharmacogenomic data.

Transcriptional and methylation outcomes of didehydro-cortistatin A use in HIV-1-infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells,"Ongoing viral transcription from the reservoir of HIV-1 infected long-lived memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells presents a barrier to cure and associates with poorer health outcomes for people living with HIV, including chronic immune activation and inflammation. We previously reported that didehydro-cortistatin A (dCA), an HIV-1 Tat inhibitor, blocks HIV-1 transcription. Here, we examine the impact of dCA on host immune CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell transcriptional and epigenetic states. We performed a comprehensive analysis of genome-wide transcriptomic and DNA methylation profiles upon long-term dCA treatment of primary human memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. dCA prompted specific transcriptional and DNA methylation changes in cell cycle, histone, interferon-response, and T-cell lineage transcription factor genes, through inhibition of both HIV-1 and Mediator kinases. These alterations establish a tolerogenic Treg/Th2 phenotype, reducing viral gene expression and mitigating inflammation in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during HIV-1 infection. In addition, dCA suppresses the expression of lineage-defining transcription factors for Th17 and Th1 cells, critical HIV-1 targets, and reservoirs. dCA's benefits thus extend beyond viral transcription inhibition, modulating the immune cell landscape to limit HIV-1 acquisition and inflammatory environment linked to HIV infection",PubMed
"Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of bone age maturation during peri-pubertal growth in children with type I, III and IV osteogenesis imperfecta","Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)is a rare genetically heterogeneous disorder caused by changes in the expression or processing of type I collagen. Clinical manifestations include bone fragility, decreased linear growth, and skeletal deformities that vary in severity. In typically growing children, skeletal maturation proceeds in a predictable pattern of changes in the size, shape, and mineralization on the hand and wrist bones that can be followed radiographically known at the bone age. Assessment of bone age can be clinically used to assess time remaining for linear growth, and the onset and duration of puberty, both of which can be useful in determining the timing of some surgeries or the interpretation of other imaging modalities such as bone densitometry. Additionally, deviations in the expected maturation process of the bone age may prompt or assist in the work up of a significant delay or advancement in a child's growth pattern. The primary aim of our study was to determine whether the bone age in children with a skeletal disorder such as OI follow the same pattern and rate of bone maturation compared to a control population. Using participants from the Natural History Study of the Brittle Bone Disorders Consortium, we analyzed 159 left hand and wrist radiographs (bone age) for a cross-sectional analysis and 55 bone ages repeated at approximately 24 months for a longitudinal analysis of skeletal maturation. Bone ages were read by a pediatric endocrinologist and by an automated analysis using a program called BoneXpert. Our results demonstrated that in children with mild-to-moderate OI (types I and IV), the skeletal maturation is comparable to chronological age-mated controls. For those with more severe forms of OI (type III), there is a delayed pattern of skeletal maturation of less than a year (10.5 months CI 5.1-16) P = 0.0012) at baseline and a delayed rate of maturation over the two-year follow up compared to type I (P = 0.06) and type III (P = 0.02). However, despite these parameters being statistically different, they may not be clinically significant. We conclude the bone age, with careful interpretation, can be used in the OI population in a way that is similar to the general pediatric population",PubMed
Osteoporosis and coronary heart disease: a bi-directional Mendelian randomization study,"Osteoporosis (OP) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are major global public health issues, especially exacerbated by the challenges of an aging population. As these problems intensify, the associated burden on global health is expected to increase significantly. Despite extensive epidemiological investigations into the potential association between OP and CVD, establishing a clear causal relationship remains elusive. Instrumental variables were selected from summary statistics of the IEU GWAS database. Five different components of BMD (heel BMD, LS BMD, FA BMD, FN BMD, and TB BMD) were used as OP phenotypes. CHD, MI, and stroke were selected to represent CVD. Multiple analysis methods were used to evaluate the causal relationship between CVD and OP comprehensively. In addition, sensitivity analyses(Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, and ""leave one out"" analysis) were performed to verify the reliability of the results. The MR showed a significant causal relationship between CHD on heel BMD and TB BMD; in the reverse analysis, there was no evidence that OP has a significant causal effect on CVD. The reliability of the results was confirmed through sensitivity analysis. The study results revealed that CHD was causally associated with Heel BMD and TB BMD, while in the reverse MR analysis, the causal relationship between OP and CVD was not supported. This result posits CHD as a potential etiological factor for OP and prompts that routine bone density assessment at traditional sites (forearm, femoral neck, lumbar spine) using DAX may inadequately discern underlying osteoporosis issues in CHD patients. The recommendation is to synergistically incorporate heel ultrasound or DAX for total body bone density examinations, ensuring clinical diagnostics are both precise and reliable. Moreover, these findings provide valuable insights for public health, contributing to the development of pertinent prevention and treatment strategies",PubMed
Weakly Supervised Classification for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma with Transformer in Whole Slide Images,"Pathological examination of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an indispensable factor for diagnosis, guiding clinical treatment and judging prognosis. Traditional and fully supervised NPC diagnosis algorithms require manual delineation of regions of interest on the gigapixel of whole slide images (WSIs), which however is laborious and often biased. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised framework based on Tokens-to-Token Vision Transformer (WS-T2T-ViT) for accurate NPC classification with only a slide-level label. The label of tile images is inherited from their slide-level label. Specifically, WS-T2T-ViT is composed of the multi-resolution pyramid, T2T-ViT and multi-scale attention module. The multi-resolution pyramid is designed for imitating the coarse-to-fine process of manual pathological analysis to learn features from different magnification levels. The T2T module captures the local and global features to overcome the lack of global information. The multi-scale attention module improves classification performance by weighting the contributions of different granularity levels. Extensive experiments are performed on the 802-patient NPC and CAMELYON16 dataset. WS-T2T-ViT achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.989 for NPC classification on the NPC dataset. The experiment results of CAMELYON16 dataset demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of WS-T2T-ViT in WSI-level classification",PubMed
Discovery of genomic and transcriptomic pleiotropy between kidney function and soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products using correlated meta-analyses: The Long Life Family Study (LLFS),"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have increased oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, which may escalate the production of advanced glycation end-products (AGE). High soluble receptor for AGE (sRAGE) and low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels are associated with CKD and aging. We evaluated whether eGFR calculated from creatinine and cystatin C share pleiotropic genetic factors with sRAGE. We employed whole-genome sequencing and correlated meta-analyses on combined genomewide association study (GWAS) p-values in 4,182 individuals (age range: 24-110) from the Long Life Family Study (LLFS). We also conducted transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) on whole blood in a subset of 1,209 individuals. We identified 59 pleiotropic GWAS loci (p<5x10-8) and 17 TWAS genes (Bonferroni-p<2.73x10-6) for eGFR traits and sRAGE. TWAS genes, LSP1 and MIR23AHG, were associated with eGFR and sRAGE located within GWAS loci, lncRNA-KCNQ1OT1 and CACNA1A/CCDC130, respectively. GWAS variants were eQTLs in the kidney glomeruli and tubules, and GWAS genes predicted kidney carcinoma. TWAS genes harbored eQTLs in the kidney, predicted kidney carcinoma, and connected enhancer-promoter variants with kidney function-related phenotypes at p<5x10-8. Additionally, higher allele frequencies of protective variants for eGFR traits were detected in LLFS than in ALFA-Europeans and TOPMed, suggesting better kidney function in healthy-aging LLFS than in general populations. Integrating genomic annotation and transcriptional gene activity revealed the enrichment of genetic elements in kidney function and kidney diseases. The identified pleiotropic loci and gene expressions for eGFR and sRAGE suggest their underlying shared genetic effects and highlight their roles in kidney- and aging-related signaling pathways",medrxiv
An Unusual Case of Pheochromocytoma Associated with von Hippel-Lindau Disease and Lynch Syndrome During Pregnancy,"Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) and/or paragangliomas (PGLs) are a challenge to diagnose during pregnancy because of elusive signs and testing difficulties. We report a 25-year-old woman with no pertinent medical history who presented to the hospital with hypertension, vision loss, and weakness and was initially diagnosed with preeclampsia. Imaging showed hemangioblastomas in the medulla and thoracic spine, pancreatic cysts, and a renal cyst. The endocrinology service was consulted for possible PCCs associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL). Serum and urine normetanephrine levels were elevated despite the lack of overt PCCs/PGLs seen on magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography. The patient was medically managed with doxazosin and then labetalol. Despite successful resection of the hemangioblastoma in the medulla, the patient suffered respiratory distress requiring tracheostomy and venous-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) and fetal demise. After 3 months, the patient was discharged to rehabilitation. Follow-up genetics were heterozygous for VHL and Lynch syndrome. DOTATATE positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan showed a small hepatic focus of a maximum standard uptake value of 12.1. Altogether, this case illustrates the importance of prompt diagnosis and proper management of PCCs/PGLs during pregnancy and incorporating genetic information during surveillance to lower morbidity and mortality",PubMed
DNA methylation episignature and comparative epigenomic profiling for Pitt-Hopkins syndrome caused by TCF4 variants,"Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by pathogenic variants in TCF4, leading to intellectual disability, specific morphological features, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Epigenetic dysregulation has been implicated in PTHS, prompting the investigation of a DNA methylation (DNAm) ""episignature"" specific to PTHS for diagnostic purposes and variant reclassification and functional insights into the molecular pathophysiology of this disorder. A cohort of 67 individuals with genetically confirmed PTHS and three individuals with intellectual disability and a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in TCF4 were studied. The DNAm episignature was developed with an Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip array analysis using peripheral blood cells. Support vector machine (SVM) modeling and clustering methods were employed to generate a DNAm classifier for PTHS. Validation was extended to an additional cohort of 11 individuals with PTHS. The episignature was assessed in relation to other neurodevelopmental disorders and its specificity was examined. A specific DNAm episignature for PTHS was established. The classifier exhibited high sensitivity for TCF4 haploinsufficiency and missense variants in the basic-helix-loop-helix domain. Notably, seven individuals with TCF4 variants exhibited negative episignatures, suggesting complexities related to mosaicism, genetic factors, and environmental influences. The episignature displayed degrees of overlap with other related disorders and biological pathways. This study defines a DNAm episignature for TCF4-related PTHS, enabling improved diagnostic accuracy and VUS reclassification. The finding that some cases scored negatively underscores the potential for multiple or nested episignatures and emphasizes the need for continued investigation to enhance specificity and coverage across PTHS-related variants",PubMed
Investigation of a Novel Mouse Model of Prader-Willi Syndrome with Invalidation of Necdin and Magel2,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multigenic disorder caused by the loss of seven contiguous paternally expressed genes. Mouse models with inactivation of all PWS genes are lethal. Knockout (KO) mouse models for each candidate gene were generated, but they lack the functional interactions between PWS genes. Here, we revealed an interplay between Necdin and Magel2 ""PWS"" genes and generated a novel mouse model (named ""Madin"") with a deletion including both genes. A subset of Madin KO mice showed neonatal lethality. Behaviorally, surviving mutant mice exhibited sensory delays during infancy and alterations in social exploration at adulthood. Madin KO mice had a lower body weight before weaning, persisting after weaning in males only, with reduced fat mass and improved glucose tolerance. Delayed sexual maturation and altered timing of puberty onset were observed in mutant mice. Adult Madin KO mice displayed increased ventilation and a persistent increase in apneas following a hypercapnic challenge. Transcriptomics analyses revealed a dysregulation of key circadian genes and alterations of genes associated with axonal function that were also found in the hypothalamus of patients with PWS. At neuroanatomical levels, we report an impaired maturation of oxytocin neurons and a disrupted development of melanocortin circuits. Together, these data indicate that the Madin KO mouse is a reliable and more genetically relevant model for the study of PWS",biorxiv
Deep representation learning for clustering longitudinal survival data from electronic health records,"Precision medicine can be defined as providing the right treatment to the right patient at the right time, and it requires the ability to identify clinically relevant patient subgroups with high accuracy. The increasing availability of large-scale electronic health records (EHR) datasets has provided major opportunities for artificial intelligence and machine learning in mining such complex datasets for identifying novel disease subtypes. However, disease subtypes often exist in the context of certain disease-relevant risk events, and current efforts have been limited by analyzing clustering and event risk independently, resulting in subgroups that still display great heterogeneity in event risk and/or underlying molecular mechanisms.  To address this problem, we developed TransVarSur (Transformer Variational Survival modeling). TransVarSur integrates a Transformer-based Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder with time-to-event modeling to capture complex relationships between cluster-specific EHR trajectories and survival times. We validated TransVarSur by showing superior performance relative to baseline methods, on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets with known ground-truth clustering. We then applied TransVarSur to 1908 Crohns disease patients from the UK Biobank and successfully identified four clusters displaying both divergent EHR trajectories and divergent progression towards the risk event intestinal obstruction. A further analysis of the clusters revealed known clinical and genetic factors relevant in Crohns disease and progression to intestinal obstruction.  In conclusion, we demonstrated TransVarSurs ability to accurately stratify a patient population into clinically and genetically relevant, risk-associated subgroups. Hence, it can be a powerful tool in the development of precision medicine approaches",medrxiv
Empowering effective biomarker-driven precision oncology: A call to action,"Precision oncology has a significant role to play in delivering optimal patient care. Biomarkers are critical enablers for precision oncology across the continuum of cancer diagnosis, in defining patient prognosis, and in predicting the response to treatments and their potential toxicities, as well as delineating the risk of hereditary cancer syndromes. Biomarkers also potentiate cancer drug development, accelerating patient access to safe and effective therapies. However, despite an accurate and timely diagnosis being critical to patient survival, advances in genomic testing are not being fully exploited in daily clinical practice, leading to missed opportunities to deliver the most effective treatments for patients. Biomarker testing availability and implementation often lag behind approvals of respective biomarker-informed therapies, limiting prompt patient access to these life-saving drugs. Multiple factors currently impede the routine adoption of biomarker testing including, but not limited to, cost, lack of test reimbursement, limited access, regulatory hurdles, lack of knowledge, insufficient cooperation on assay development, and the urgent need to harmonize and validate testing assays, all leading to inefficient diagnostic pathways. Clinical guidelines increasingly include genomic profiling, and recent evidence suggests that precision oncology can be delivered in a cost-effective way for financially-challenged health systems. Therefore, precision genomic testing for cancer biomarkers must be embedded into the clinical practice of oncology care delivery going forward. We articulate a series of recommendations and a call to action to underpin the mainstreaming of a biomarker-informed precision oncology approach to enhance patient outcomes and deliver cost effective 21st century cancer care",PubMed
The causal role of male pubertal timing for the development of externalizing and internalizing traits: results from Mendelian randomization studies,"Preexisting epidemiological studies suggest that early pubertal development in males is associated with externalizing (e.g., conduct problems, risky behavior, and aggression) and internalizing (e.g., depression and anxiety) traits and disorders. However, due to problems inherent to observational studies, especially of reverse causation and residual confounding, it remains unclear whether these associations are causal. Mendelian randomization (MR) studies take advantage of the random allocation of genes at conception and can establish causal relationships. In the current study, N=76 independent genetic variants for male puberty timing (MPT) were derived from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 205,354 participants and used as an instrumental variable in MR studies on 17 externalizing and internalizing traits and psychopathologies utilizing outcome GWAS with 16,400 to 1,045,957 participants. In these MR studies, earlier MPT was significantly associated with higher scores for the overarching phenotype of  Externalizing Traits (beta=-0.03, 95%-CI [-0.06, -0.01]). However, this effect was likely driven by an earlier age at first sex (beta=-0.17, 95%-CI [-0.21, - 0.13]), without evidence for an effect on further externalizing phenotypes. Regarding internalizing phenotypes, earlier MPT was associated with higher levels of the  Depressed Affect subdomain of neuroticism (beta=-0.04, 95%-CI [-0.07, -0.01]). Late MPT was related to higher scores of internalizing traits in early life (beta=0.04, 95%-CI [0.01, 0.08]). In conclusion, this MR study supports a causal effect of MPT on specific traits and behaviors. However, no evidence for an effect of MPT on long-term clinical outcomes (depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol dependency, cannabis abuse) was found",medrxiv
Recognizing clinical features of primary ciliary dyskinesia in the perinatal period,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, motile ciliopathy inherited through mostly autosomal recessive variants that results in chronic ear, sinus, and respiratory disease. Despite neonatal respiratory distress being a common presenting symptom in term infants with PCD, the diagnosis is often delayed due to non-familiarity of neonatal caregivers with phenotypic and diagnostic features of this disease. Organ laterality defects, prenatal cerebral ventriculomegaly, and a family history of suppurative respiratory disease may occur in PCD and should prompt neonatal testing for this condition. In this review of neonatal PCD diagnoses in a large PCD clinic, prevalence and details of neonatal PCD issues are presented, highlighting the typically delayed onset of neonatal respiratory distress and lobar atelectasis on chest radiography, specific presentations in premature neonates, and responses to perinatal therapies",PubMed
Navigating the Evolving Landscape of Primary Hyperoxaluria: Traditional Management Defied by the Rise of Novel Molecular Drugs,"Primary hyperoxalurias (PHs) are inherited metabolic disorders marked by enzymatic cascade disruption, leading to excessive oxalate production that is subsequently excreted in the urine. Calcium oxalate deposition in the renal tubules and interstitium triggers renal injury, precipitating systemic oxalate build-up and subsequent secondary organ impairment. Recent explorations of novel therapeutic strategies have challenged and necessitated the reassessment of established management frameworks. The execution of diverse clinical trials across various medication classes has provided new insights and knowledge. With the evolution of PH treatments reaching a new milestone, prompt and accurate diagnosis is increasingly critical. Developing early, effective management and treatment plans is essential to improve the long-term quality of life for PH patients",PubMed
A Novel Variant of the PIK3R1 Gene Mutation Associated With SHORT Syndrome and Agammaglobulinemia,"Primary immunodeficiencies are disorders of the immune system often caused by mutations of genes required for lymphocyte development. Phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1) gene mutations are associated with SHORT syndrome, a rare multisystem disease. The name stands for Short stature, Hyperextensibility, Ocular depression, Rieger anomaly and Teething delay. Our case describes a child who presented with agammaglobulinemia with phenotypical features of SHORT syndrome. Upon further investigation, he was found to have a rare variant of the PIK3R1 gene mutation. This new mutation combines two distinct diseases with the same gene defect, which otherwise has been reported as two separate entities. The objective of this report is to identify a new gene mutation associated with SHORT syndrome along with agammaglobulinemia and to highlight the importance of recognizing the features of SHORT syndrome. We describe a nine-year-old male who presented with developmental delay and recurrent infections at the age of 12 months. Immunological evaluation revealed agammaglobulinemia and he has been scheduled for regular intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy. In view of characteristic syndromic physical features, speech and teething delay, we investigated further for the underlying genetic reason for agammaglobulinemia. The molecular analysis demonstrated a rare homozygous variant, c.244dup, in the PIK3R1 gene. This case reveals the association of the PIK3R1 gene mutation with agammaglobulinemia and SHORT syndrome. It further demonstrates the discovery of a new pathological variant of the gene. A detailed history and examination along with an immunological and genetic workup should be carried out for children with certain distinct phenotypical features. SHORT syndrome has specific characteristics that call for awareness and early recognition for prompt diagnosis and intervention. Emphasis is placed on genetic counseling as the disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, as demonstrated by molecular genetic studies",PubMed
Sudden pediatric death unveiling pulmonary arteriovenous malformations,"Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are abnormal vascular connections between pulmonary arteries and veins, often associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Most PAVMs are asymptomatic, but life-threatening complications like pulmonary hemorrhage, brain abscesses, and paradoxical emboli can emerge, so prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial. We report a case of sudden pediatric death in a two-year-old female with no past medical history. Initial vomiting and fast deterioration resulted in a sudden cardiac arrest. The postmortem examination found histological evidence of consistent, extensive lung damage. The absence of the characteristic symptoms made for some challenges when it came to diagnosis, showing precisely that in early life, you could well have many difficulties in catching PAVMs. This case highlights the need to take PAVMs into account as a potential cause of sudden death, particularly when there are no conspicuous symptoms. Awareness among forensic pathologists and consideration of genetic analysis for HHT in such cases is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management",PubMed
Advancing Understanding of Inequities in Rare Disease Genomics,"PurposeAdvances in genomic research have led to the diagnosis of rare, early-onset diseases for thousands of individuals. Unfortunately, the benefits of advanced genetic diagnostic technology are not distributed equitably among the population, as has been seen in many other healthcare contexts. Even quantifying and describing inequities in genetic diagnostic yield is challenging due to variation in referrals to clinical genetics practices and other barriers to clinical genetic testing.  MethodsThe Rare Genomes Project (RGP) at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard offers research genome sequencing to individuals with rare disease who remain genetically undiagnosed through direct interaction with the individual or family. This presents an opportunity for diagnosis beyond the clinical context, thus eliminating many barriers to access.  FindingsAn initial goal of RGP was to equalize access to genomic sequencing by decoupling testing access from proximity to a major medical center and physician referral. However, our study participants are overwhelmingly non-disadvantaged, as evidenced by their access to specialist care and genetic testing prior to RGP enrollment, and are also predominantly white.  ImplicationsWe therefore describe our novel initiative to diversify RGP enrollment in order to advance equity in rare disease genetic diagnosis and research. In addition to the moral imperative of medical equity, this is also critical in order to fully understand the genomic underpinnings of rare disease. We utilize a mixed methods approach to understand the priorities and values of underrepresented communities, existing disparities, and the obstacles to addressing them: all of which is necessary to promote equity in future genomic medicine initiatives",medrxiv
Natural language processing and expert follow-up establishes tachycardia association with CDKL5 deficiency disorder,"PurposeCDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with multisystemic comorbidities. Cardiovascular involvement in CDD was shown in animal models but is yet poorly described in CDD cohorts.  MethodsWe identified 38 individuals with genetically confirmed CDD through the Cleveland Clinic CDD specialty clinic and matched 190 individuals with non-genetic epilepsy to them as a comparison group. Natural language processing was applied to yield Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms from medical records. We conducted HPO association testing and manual chart review to explore cardiovascular comorbidities associated with CDD.  ResultsWe extracted 243,541 HPO terms from 30,512 medical encounters. Phenome-wide analysis confirmed well-established CDD phenotypes and identified association of tachycardia with CDD (OR 4.2, 95%CI 1.75-9.93, padj<0.001). We found a 99.6-fold enrichment of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in CDD encounter notes (padj < 0.001), which led to identification of two cases of fetal/neonatal onset SVT previously undescribed in CDD. Tachycardia in CDD individuals was associated with the presence of other autonomic symptoms (OR 5.63, 95%CI 1.08-40.3, p=0.038).  ConclusionsCDD is associated with tachycardia, potentially including early-onset supraventricular tachycardia. Alongside prospective validation studies, semiautomated genotype-phenotype analysis with matched controls is a scalable, rapid, and efficient approach for validating known and identifying novel phenotype associations",medrxiv
Prenatal molecular diagnosis of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency enables rapid initiation of ketogenic diet,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (PDCD) is a mitochondrial disorder of carbohydrate oxidation characterized by lactic acidosis and central nervous system involvement. Knowledge of the affected metabolic pathways and clinical observations suggest that early initiation of the ketogenic diet may ameliorate the metabolic and neurologic course of the disease. We present a case in which first trimester ultrasound identified structural brain abnormalities prompting a prenatal molecular diagnosis of PDCD. Ketogenic diet, thiamine, and N-acetylcysteine were initiated in the perinatal period with good response, including sustained developmental progress. This case highlights the importance of a robust neurometabolic differential diagnosis for prenatally diagnosed structural anomalies and the use of prenatal molecular testing to facilitate rapid, genetically tailored intervention",PubMed
Cardiovascular Pharmacogenetics: From Discovery of Genetic Association to Clinical Adoption of Derived Test,"Recent breakthroughs in human genetics and in information technologies have markedly expanded our understanding at the molecular level of the response to drugs, i.e., pharmacogenetics (PGx), across therapy areas. This review is restricted to PGx for cardiovascular (CV) drugs. First, we examined the PGx information in the labels approved by regulatory agencies in Europe, Japan, and North America and related recommendations from expert panels. Out of 221 marketed CV drugs, 36 had PGx information in their labels approved by one or more agencies. The level of annotations and recommendations varied markedly between agencies and expert panels. Clopidogrel is the only CV drug with consistent PGx recommendation (i.e., ""actionable""). This situation prompted us to dissect the steps from discovery of a PGx association to clinical translation. We found 101 genome-wide association studies that investigated the response to CV drugs or drug classes. These studies reported significant associations for 48 PGx traits mapping to 306 genes. Six of these 306 genes are mentioned in the corresponding PGx labels or recommendations for CV drugs. Genomic analyses also highlighted the wide between-population differences in risk allele frequencies and the individual load of actionable PGx variants. Given the high attrition rate and the long road to clinical translation, additional work is warranted to identify and validate PGx variants for more CV drugs across diverse populations and to demonstrate the utility of PGx testing. To that end, pre-emptive PGx combining genomic profiling with electronic medical records opens unprecedented opportunities to improve healthcare, for CV diseases and beyond. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Despite spectacular breakthroughs in human molecular genetics and information technologies, consistent evidence supporting PGx testing in the cardiovascular area is limited to a few drugs. Additional work is warranted to discover and validate new PGx markers and demonstrate their utility. Pre-emptive PGx combining genomic profiling with electronic medical records opens unprecedented opportunities to improve healthcare, for CV diseases and beyond",PubMed
"Bioinformatics analysis of the potential biomarkers of Multiple Sclerosis and Guillain-Barré syndrome
==========
Bioinformatics analysis of the potential biomarkers of Multiple Sclerosis and Guillain-Barre syndrome","Recent research emphasizes the intricate interplay of genetics and epigenetics in neurological disorders, notably Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), both of which exhibit cardiovascular dysregulation, with GBS often featuring serious bradyarrhythmias requiring prompt recognition and treatment. While cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in MS is typically less severe, orthostatic intolerance affects around half of MS patients. Their distinction lies in their autoimmune responses, MS is an autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system, causes demyelination and axon damage, leading to cognitive, ocular, and musculoskeletal dysfunction. In contrast, GBS primarily affects the peripheral nervous system, resulting in paralysis and respiratory complications. Despite their differences, both diseases share environmental risk factors such as viral infections and Vitamin D deficiency. This study aims to explore shared gene expression pathways, functional annotations, and molecular pathways between MS and GBS to enhance diagnostics, pathogenesis understanding, and treatment strategies through molecular analysis techniques. Through the gene expression analysis, five significant genes were found UTS2, TNFSF10, GBP1, VCAN, FOS. Results shows that Common DEGs are linked to apoptosis, bacterial infections, and atherosclerosis. Molecular docking analysis suggests Aflatoxin B1 as a potential therapeutic compound due to its high binding affinity with common differentially expressed proteins","PubMed,biorxiv"
Retinal Focal Nodular Gliosis (Vasoproliferative Tumors) Have Varied Clinical Courses Requiring Tailored Management: A Case Series,"Retinal focal nodular gliosis (FNG), also known as vasoproliferative tumors (VPTs), are rare, benign vascular tumors associated with exudation with no current consensus on management. Herein, we describe the varied clinical course and management of 3 patients with retinal FNG, one of whom is associated with retinitis pigmentosa. Case 1 is a 76-year-old female who presented with reduced vision and distortion secondary to a vitreous hemorrhage and epiretinal membrane (ERM) as complications of a known small peripheral retinal FNG. She underwent vitrectomy for the hemorrhage to relieve vascular traction and the ERM peel, and the tumor was kept under observation. Case 2 is a 24-year-old female with genetically uncharacterized retinitis pigmentosa-like phenotype who presented with gradual loss of central vision in one eye due to cystoid macular oedema (CMO). She was found to have two peripheral retinal areas of FNG located inferonasally. Tumors were treated with cryotherapy and adjuvant intraocular steroid implant to control the CMO. Case 3 is a 28-year-old female with retinitis pigmentosa secondary to genetically confirmed variant in CRB1 gene who presented with intractable right eye CMO and localized inferior serous retinal detachment secondary to a large inferotemporal FNG. Her left eye has no light perception vision due to previous extensive serous retinal detachment and anterior segment ischemia. The right eye tumor was managed with multiple rounds of cryotherapy and laser therapy to control the serous detachment. Despite this, the condition progressed and was ultimately treated with plaque brachytherapy. Unfortunately, this resulted in extensive retinal inflammation causing annular tractional retinal detachment which was treated with combined pars plana vitrectomy and scleral buckle. We characterized the retinal phenotype of 3 patients with retinal FNG (VPTs) and found them to have varied clinical courses requiring tailored surgical management. The case associated with retinitis pigmentosa had a known pathogenic variant in Crumbs homolog-1 (CRB1) gene affecting retinal structure and exhibited a more severe clinical course. It is therefore important for patients with retinal dystrophies to undergo thorough peripheral examinations and detect FNG early as they may require prompt, aggressive treatment",PubMed

"Genetic polymorphisms, biomarkers and signaling pathways associated with septic shock: from diagnosis to therapeutic targets","Septic shock is a severe form of sepsis characterized by high global mortality rates and significant heritability. Clinicians have long been perplexed by the differential expression of genes, which poses challenges for early diagnosis and prompt treatment of septic shock. Genetic polymorphisms play crucial roles in determining susceptibility to, mortality from, and the prognosis of septic shock. Research indicates that pathogenic genes are known to cause septic shock through specific alleles, and protective genes have been shown to confer beneficial effects on affected individuals. Despite the existence of many biomarkers linked to septic shock, their clinical use remains limited. Therefore, further investigation is needed to identify specific biomarkers that can facilitate early prevention, diagnosis and risk stratification. Septic shock is closely associated with multiple signaling pathways, including the toll-like receptor 2/toll-like receptor 4, tumor necrosis factor-α, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B, mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor κB, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, mammalian target of rapamycin, NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain-associated protein 3 and hypoxia-induced-factor-1 pathways. Understanding the regulation of these signaling pathways may lead to the identification of therapeutic targets for the development of novel drugs to treat sepsis or septic shock. In conclusion, identifying differential gene expression during the development of septic shock allows physicians to stratify patients according to risk at an early stage. Furthermore, auxiliary examinations can assist physicians in identifying therapeutic targets within relevant signaling pathways, facilitating early diagnosis and treatment, reducing mortality and improving the prognosis of septic shock patients. Although there has been significant progress in studying the genetic polymorphisms, specific biomarkers and signaling pathways involved in septic shock, the journey toward their clinical application and widespread implementation still lies ahead",PubMed
Association between cathepsins and skin cancers: A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study,"Several cathepsins have been identified as being involved in the development of cancer. Nevertheless, the connection between cathepsins and skin cancers remained highly elusive. A bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to investigate the causal association between cathepsins and skin malignancies. The genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data for cathepsins, malignant melanoma (MM), and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) were obtained from European research. The primary method employed was inverse variance weighted. In addition, MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode were also executed. Sensitivity analysis was performed using Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO. From univariable MR (UVMR), cathepsin H, and S were determined to have a causal relationship with BCC. Additionally, cathepsin H was identified as associated with MM. Multivariable MR (MVMR) showed that after correcting for risk factors of skin carcinoma, cathepsin H was detected to be protective against BCC, whereas cathepsin S has been observed as a risk factor for BCC. No substantial pleiotropy and heterogeneity were identified in the sensitivity analysis. This study was the first to establish a direct link between cathepsins and skin malignancies. Cathepsin H and S have the potential to serve as new biomarkers for BCC, offering valuable assistance in the prompt identification, treatment, and prevention of the disease. Nevertheless, additional clinical trials are required to validate our findings",PubMed
Polygenic outcomes of sexually antagonistic selection,"Sexual antagonism occurs when males and females have different fitness optima for a phenotype, but are constrained from evolving to these optima because of their shared genome. We study the response of a polygenic phenotype to the onset of sexually antagonistic selection, modeling a phenotype initially under stabilizing selection around an optimum, followed by a sudden divergence of the male and female optima. We observe rapid phenotypic evolution to these new optima via small changes in allele frequencies genome-wide. We study the role of sex chromosomes in this divergence and find that, in the absence of dosage compensation, the X chromosome favors evolution toward the female optimum, inducing co-evolutionary male-biased responses on the autosomes. However, dosage compensation obscures the female-biased interests of the X, causing it to contribute equally to male and female phenotypic change. In both scenarios, we see little effect of dominance in the genetic variation utilized by the X chromosome vs. the autosomes. We go on to examine the dynamics of stabilizing selection once the male and female optima have been reached, exploring a subtle mechanism through which the X chromosome, via the Bulmer effect, can cause higher equilibrium phenotypic variance in males than females. Finally, we consider how sexual antagonistic selection might persist across longer time scales, demonstrating that random fluctuations in an adaptive landscape can generate prolonged intragenomic conflict. Overall, our results provide insight into the response of complex phenotypes to sexually antagonistic selection and the evolution of sexual dimorphism",biorxiv
Hydroxyurea in the sickle cell disease modern era,"Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder characterized by hemoglobin S polymerization leading to vaso-occlusion and hemolytic anemia. These result in a variety of pathological events, causing both acute and chronic complications. Millions around the world are affected by sickle cell disease with predominance in sub-Saharan Africa. Hydroxyurea was the first drug approved for use in sickle cell disease to reduce the occurrence of painful crises and blood transfusions in patients with frequent, moderate to severe painful crises. With the development of new therapeutics, the role of hydroxyurea is evolving. This narrative review aims to provide clinical data, safety information, and supplementary evidence for the role of hydroxyurea in the current era of sickle cell disease. A comprehensive literature search of databases, including PubMed and Cochrane Library, was conducted from 1963 to 2024. Even though new medications have been approved for sickle cell disease, hydroxyurea remains the gold standard. Hydroxyurea is not only a disease modifier but it has additional clinical benefits, it is affordable, and its longevity has prompted expanded research in areas such as underutilization and pharmacogenomics. As the treatment landscape evolves, hydroxyurea's long-standing record of efficacy and safety continues to support its role as a key agent in disease management",PubMed
A Foundational Large Language Model for Edible Plant Genomes,"Significant progress has been made in the field of plant genomics, as demonstrated by the increased use of high-throughput methodologies that enable the characterization of multiple genome-wide molecular phenotypes.

A foundational large language model for edible plant genomes,"Significant progress has been made in the field of plant genomics, as demonstrated by the increased use of high-throughput methodologies that enable the characterization of multiple genome-wide molecular phenotypes.

The Case for Retaining Natural Language Descriptions of Phenotypes in Plant Databases and a Web Application as Proof of Concept,"Similarities in phenotypic descriptions can be indicative of shared genetics, metabolism, and stress responses, to name a few. Finding and measuring similarity across descriptions of phenotype is not straightforward, with previous successes in computation requiring a great deal of expert data curation. Natural language processing of free text descriptions of phenotype is often less resource intensive than applying expert curation. It is therefore critical to understand the performance of natural language processing techniques for organizing and analyzing biological datasets and for enabling biological discovery. For predicting similar phenotypes, a wide variety of approaches from the natural language processing domain perform as well as curation-based methods. These computational approaches also show promise both for helping curators organize and work with large datasets and for enabling researchers to explore relationships among available phenotype descriptions. Here we generate networks of phenotype similarity and share a web application for querying a dataset of associated plant genes using these text mining approaches. Example situations and species for which application of these techniques is most useful are discussed.  Database URLsThe database and analytical tool called QuOATS are available at https://quoats.dill-picl.org/. Code for the web application is available at https://git.io/Jtv9J.

Current status of artificial intelligence methods for skin cancer survival analysis: a scoping review,"Skin cancer mortality rates continue to rise, and survival analysis is increasingly needed to understand who is at risk and what interventions improve outcomes. However, current statistical methods are limited by inability to synthesize multiple data types, such as patient genetics, clinical history, demographics, and pathology and reveal significant multimodal relationships through predictive algorithms. Advances in computing power and data science enabled the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), which synthesizes vast amounts of data and applies algorithms that enable personalized diagnostic approaches. Here, we analyze AI methods used in skin cancer survival analysis, focusing on supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. We illustrate strengths and weaknesses of these approaches with examples. Our PubMed search yielded 14 publications meeting inclusion criteria for this scoping review. Most publications focused on melanoma, particularly histopathologic interpretation with deep learning. Such concentration on a single type of skin cancer amid increasing focus on deep learning highlight growing areas for innovation; however, it also demonstrates opportunity for additional analysis that addresses other types of cutaneous malignancies and expands the scope of prognostication to combine both genetic, histopathologic, and clinical data. Moreover, researchers may leverage multiple AI methods for enhanced benefit in analyses. Expanding AI to this arena may enable improved survival analysis, targeted treatments, and outcomes",PubMed
"Nanopore-based analysis unravels the genetic landscape and phylogenetic placement of human-infecting Trichuris species in Cote d'Ivoire, Tanzania, Uganda, and Laos","Soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH), including trichuriasis, pose a significant global burden, affecting numerous mammalian hosts. Traditional diagnostic methods have struggled to differentiate species within the Trichuris genus, prompting the use of molecular techniques to understand the diversity and zoonotic transmission of Trichuris spp. among humans and non-human primates (NHP), dogs and pigs. In this study, we used nanopore-based full-length ITS2 rDNA sequencing to genetically characterize and confirm the phylogenetic placement of the newly identified human-infecting Trichuris hominis and the well-known Trichuris trichiura. Using 670 samples from clinical studies in Cote dIvoire, Laos, Tanzania, and Uganda, along with publicly available ITS2 sequences, we confirmed two distinct clusters of human-infecting Trichuris species. We found a varying prevalence of T. hominis and T. trichiura across the four countries and that these were also present in NHP. Additionally, we demonstrated that ITS2 fragment length accurately differentiates both human-infecting Trichuris species and thus makes it a good diagnostic marker for future point-of-care applications in resource-constrained settings",biorxiv
Late-onset Kjellin syndrome: Diagnosis of SPG11 on fundus examination,"Spastic paraplegia (SPG) is a heterogenous group of neurodegenerative disorders, that may include ocular involvement. Here we report the clinical data of a patient with late-onset Kjellin syndrome, a peculiar form of hereditary SPG with macular dystrophy. Clinical, functional and multimodal retinal imaging data were collected. Genetic testing was performed by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). A 52-year-old female patient with SPG of unknown origin was referred for a progressive visual acuity loss. Multimodal fundus imaging revealed a peculiar macular dystrophy. Given the specific association of macular dystrophy and SPG, a Kjellin syndrome was suspected and genetic testing performed. WES revealed biallelic pathogenic variants in SPG11, co-segregating with disease in the family. Careful ophthalmological examination prompted the diagnosis and guided molecular testing. This case underlines the importance of a neuro-ophthalmologic assessment in patients with SPG",PubMed
Puberty Blocker and Aging Impact on Testicular Cell States and Function,"Spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) acquisition of meiotogenetic state during puberty to produce genetically diverse gametes is blocked by drugs collectively referred as  puberty blocker (PB). Investigating the impact of PB on juvenile SSC state and function is challenging due to limited tissue access and clinical data. Herein, we report largest clinically annotated juvenile testicular biorepository with all children with gender dysphoria on chronic PB treatment highlighting shift in pediatric patient demography in US. At the tissue level, we report mild-to-severe sex gland atrophy in PB treated children. We developed most extensive integrated single-cell RNA dataset to date (>100K single cells; 25 patients), merging both public and novel (52 month PB-treated) datasets, alongside innovative computational approach tailed for germ cells and evaluated the impact of PB and aging on SSC. We report novel constitutional ranges for each testicular cell type across the entire age spectrum, distinct effects of treatments on prepubertal vs adult SSC, presence of spermatogenic epithelial cells exhibiting post-meiotic-state, irrespective of age, puberty status, or PB treatment. Further, we defined distinct effects of PB and aging on testicular cell lineage composition, and SSC meiotogenetic state and function. Using single cell data from prepubertal and young adult, we were able to accurately predict sexual maturity based both on overall cell type proportions, as well as on gene expression patterns within each major cell type. Applying these models to a PB-treated patient that they appeared pre-pubertal across the entire tissue. This combined with the noted gland atrophy and abnormalities from the histology data raise a potential concern regarding the complete reversibility and reproductive fitness of SSC. The biorepository, data, and research approach presented in this study provide unique opportunity to explore the impact of PB on testicular reproductive health",biorxiv
Adolescent environmental enrichment induces social resilience and alters neural gene expression in a selectively bred rodent model with anxious phenotype,"Stress is a major influence on mental health status; the ways that individuals respond to or copes with stressors determine whether they are negatively affected in the future. Stress responses are established by an interplay between genetics, environment, and life experiences. Psychosocial stress is particularly impactful during adolescence, a critical period for the development of mood disorders. In this study we compared two established, selectively-bred Sprague Dawley rat lines, the ""internalizing"" bred Low Responder (bLR) line versus the ""externalizing"" bred High Responder (bHR) line, to investigate how genetic temperament and adolescent environment impact future responses to social interactions and psychosocial stress, and how these determinants of stress response interact. Male bLR and bHR rats were exposed to social and environmental enrichment in adolescence prior to experiencing social defeat and were then assessed for social interaction and anxiety-like behavior. Adolescent enrichment caused rats to display more social interaction, as well as nominally less social avoidance, less submission during defeat, and resilience to the effects of social stress on corticosterone, in a manner that seemed more notable in bLRs. For bHRs, enrichment also caused greater aggression during a neutral social encounter and nominally during defeat, and decreased anxiety-like behavior. To explore the neurobiology underlying the development of social resilience in the anxious phenotype bLRs, RNA-seq was conducted on the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens, two brain regions that mediate stress regulation and social behavior. Gene sets previously associated with stress, social behavior, aggression and exploratory activity were enriched with differential expression in both regions, with a particularly large effect on gene sets that regulate social behaviors. Our findings provide further evidence that adolescent enrichment can serve as an inoculating experience against future stressors. The ability to induce social resilience in a usually anxious line of animals by manipulating their environment has translational implications, as it underscores the feasibility of intervention strategies targeted at genetically vulnerable adolescent populations",biorxiv
Evaluation of Deep Learning for predicting rice traits using structural and single-nucleotide genomic variants,"Structural variants (SVs) such as deletions, inversions, duplications, and Transposable Element (TE) Insertion Polymorphisms (TIPs) are prevalent in plant genomes and have played an important role in evolution and domestication, as they constitute a significant source of genomic and phenotypic variability. Nevertheless, most methods in quantitative genetics focusing on crop improvement, such as genomic prediction, consider Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) as the only type of genetic marker. Here, we used rice to investigate whether combining the structural and nucleotide genome-wide variation can improve prediction ability of traits when compared to using only SNPs. Moreover, we also examine the potential advantage of Deep Learning (DL) networks over Bayesian Linear models, which have been widely applied in genomic prediction. Specifically, the performance of BayesC and a Bayesian Reproducible Kernel Hilbert space regressions were compared to two different DL architectures, the Multilayer Perceptron, and the Convolution Neural Network. We further explore their prediction ability by using various marker input strategies and found that exploiting structural and nucleotide variation improves prediction ability on complex traits in rice. Also, DL models outperformed Bayesian models in 75% of the studied cases. Finally, DL systematically improved prediction ability of binary traits against the Bayesian models",biorxiv
Genomic prediction for sugarcane diseases including hybrid Bayesian-machine learning approaches,"Sugarcane smut and Pachymetra root rots are two serious diseases of sugarcane, with susceptible infected crops losing over 30% of yield. A heritable component to both diseases has been demonstrated, suggesting selection could improve disease resistance. Genomic selection could accelerate gains even further, enabling early selection of resistant seedlings for breeding and clonal propagation. In this study we evaluated four types of algorithms for genomic predictions of clonal performance for disease resistance. These algorithms were: Genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), including extensions to model dominance and epistasis, Bayesian methods including BayesC and BayesR, Machine learning methods including random forest, multilayer perceptron (MLP), modified convolutional neural network (CNN) and attention networks designed to capture epistasis across the genome-wide markers. Simple hybrid methods, that first used BayesR/GWAS to identify a subset of 1000 markers with moderate to large marginal additive effects, then used attention networks to derive predictions from these effects and their interactions, were also developed and evaluated. The hypothesis for this approach was that using a subset of markers more likely to have an effect would enable better estimation of interaction effects than when there were an extremely large number of possible interactions, especially with our limited data set size. To evaluate the methods, we applied both random five-fold cross-validation and a structured PCA based cross-validation that separated 4702 sugarcane clones (that had disease phenotypes and genotyped for 26k genome wide SNP markers) by genomic relationship. The Bayesian methods (BayesR and BayesC) gave the highest accuracy of prediction, followed closely by hybrid methods with attention networks. The hybrid methods with attention networks gave the lowest variation in accuracy of prediction across validation folds (and lowest MSE), which may be a criteria worth considering in practical breeding programs. This suggests that hybrid methods incorporating the attention mechanism could be useful for genomic prediction of clonal performance, particularly where non-additive effects may be important",PubMed
Distinguishing clinical and genetic risk factors for suicidal ideation and behavior in a diverse hospital population,"Suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB) are major public health concerns, but risk factors for their development and progression are poorly understood. We used ICD codes and a natural language processing algorithm to identify individuals in a hospital biobank with SI-only, SB, and controls without either. We compared the profiles of SB and SI-only patients to controls, and each other, using phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) and polygenic risk scores (PRS). PheWAS identified many risk factors for SB and SI-only, plus specific psychiatric disorders which may be involved in progression from SI-only to SB. PRS for suicide attempt were only associated with SB, and even after accounting for psychiatric disorder PRS. SI PRS were only associated with SI-only, although not after accounting for psychiatric disorder PRS. These findings advance understanding of distinct genetic and clinical risk factors for SB and SI-only, which will aid in early detection and intervention efforts",medrxiv
Whole-genome sequencing of half-a-million UK Biobank participants,"Summary ParagraphWhole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides a comprehensive view of the genome, enabling detection of coding and non-coding genetic variation, and surveying complex regions which are difficult to genotype. Here, we report on whole-genome sequencing of 490,640 UK Biobank participants, building on previous genotyping1 and whole-exome sequencing (WES) efforts2,3. This advance deepens our understanding of how genetics influences disease biology and further enhances the value of this open resource for the study of human biology and health. Coupling this dataset with rich phenotypic data, we surveyed within- and cross-ancestry genomic associations with health-related phenotypes and identified novel genetic and clinical insights. While most genome-wide significant associations with disease traits were primarily observed in Europeans, we also identified strong or novel signals in individuals of African and Asian ancestries. Deeper capture of exonic variation in both coding and UTR sequences, strengthened and surfaced novel insights relative to WES analyses. This landmark dataset, representing the largest collection of WGS and available to the UK Biobank research community, will enable advances into our understanding of the human genome, and facilitate the discovery of new diagnostics, therapeutics with higher efficacy and improved safety profile, and enable precision medicine strategies with the potential to improve global health.

Mapping the aetiological foundations of the heart failure spectrum using human genetics,"Summary paragraphHeart failure (HF), a syndrome of symptomatic fluid overload due to cardiac dysfunction, is the most rapidly growing cardiovascular disorder. Despite recent advances, mortality and morbidity remain high and treatment innovation is challenged by limited understanding of aetiology in relation to disease subtypes. Here we harness the de-confounding properties of genetic variation to map causal biology underlying the HF phenotypic spectrum, to inform the development of more effective treatments. We report a genetic association analysis in 1.9 million ancestrally diverse individuals, including 153,174 cases of HF; 44,012 of non-ischaemic HF; 5,406 cases of non-ischaemic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); and 3,841 cases of non-ischaemic HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We identify 66 genetic susceptibility loci across HF subtypes, 37 of which have not previously been reported. We map the aetiologic contribution of risk factor traits and diseases as well as newly identified effector genes for HF, demonstrating differential risk factor effects on disease subtypes. Our findings highlight the importance of extra-cardiac tissues in HF, particularly the kidney and the vasculature in HFpEF. Pathways of cellular senescence and proteostasis are notably uncovered, including IGFBP7 as an effector gene for HFpEF. Using population approaches causally anchored in human genetics, we provide fundamental new insights into the aetiology of heart failure subtypes that may inform new approaches to prevention and treatment",medrxiv
The microbiota and immune system non-genetically affect offspring phenotypes transgenerationally,"Summary paragraphThe host-microbiota relationship has evolved to shape mammalian processes, including immunity, metabolism, and development1-3. Host phenotypes change in direct response to microbial exposures by the individual. Here we show that the microbiota induces phenotypic change not only in the individual but also in their succeeding generations of progeny. We found that germ-free mice exhibit a robust sebum secretion defect and transcriptional changes in various organs, persisting across multiple generations despite microbial colonization and breeding with conventional mice. Host-microbe interactions could be involved in this process, since T cell-deficient mice, which display defective sebum secretion4, also transgenerationally transmit their phenotype to progeny. These phenotypes are inherited by progeny conceived during in vitro fertilization using germ-free sperm and eggs, demonstrating that epigenetic information in the gametes is required for phenotypic transmission. Accordingly, small non-coding RNAs that can regulate embryonic gene expression5 were strikingly and similarly altered in gametes of germ-free and T cell-deficient mice. Thus, we have uncovered a novel mechanism whereby the microbiota and immune system induce phenotypic changes in successive generations of offspring. This epigenetic form of inheritance could be advantageous for host adaptation to environmental perturbation, where phenotypic diversity can be introduced more rapidly than by genetic mutation",biorxiv
Advances in CRISPR-Cas systems for epigenetics,"The CRISPR-Cas9 method has revolutionized the gene editing. Epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, RNA modification, and changes in histone proteins, have been intensively studied and found to play a key role in the pathogenesis of human diseases. CRISPR-While the utility of DNA and chromatin modifications, known as epigenetics, is well understood, the functional significance of various alterations of RNA nucleotides has recently gained attention. Recent advancements in improving CRISPR-based epigenetic modifications has resulted in the availability of a powerful source that can selectively modify DNA, allowing for the maintenance of epigenetic memory over several cell divisions. Accurate identification of DNA methylation at specific locations is crucial for the prompt detection of cancer and other diseases, as DNA methylation is strongly correlated to the onset as well as the advancement of such conditions. Genetic or epigenetic perturbations can disrupt the regulation of imprinted genes, resulting in the development of diseases. When histone code editors and DNA de-/ methyltransferases are coupled with catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9), and CRISPRa and CRISPRi, they demonstrate excellent efficacy in editing the epigenome of eukaryotic cells. Advancing and optimizing the extracellular delivery platform can, hence, further facilitate the manipulation of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique in upcoming clinical studies. The current chapter focuses on how the CRISP/ Cas9 system provides an avenue for the epigenetic modifications and its employability for human benefit",PubMed
Medical students' reproductive health perspectives: Pre- and post-Roe v Wade reversal,"The ability to make informed decisions about reproductive health is a cornerstone principle of the practice of prenatal medical genetics. Unfortunately, these reproductive health decisions have become entangled in the current, contentious political climate. This debate reached an inflection point in 2022 with Dobbs v. Jackson when the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) overturned the national right to abortion previously established in Roe v. Wade. This decision prompted a reassessment of the opinions of medical students on reproductive health and abortion. Our study focused on a medical school in Alabama, a conservative state that enacted a restrictive abortion ban following the Dobbs ruling. Two surveys, conducted in 2015 and 2022, explored students' viewpoints on reproductive health topics, including abortion. The comparison revealed a significant shift toward more pro-choice perspectives among medical students. Notably, religious affiliation did not consistently align with opinions, as many Christian students supported pro-choice views. Our results suggest that medical students' reproductive health opinions at our institution have shifted to a more pro-choice position over the last decade",PubMed
Multiscale Progressive Text Prompt Network for Medical Image Segmentation,"The accurate segmentation of medical images is a crucial step in obtaining reliable morphological statistics. However, training a deep neural network for this task requires a large amount of labeled data to ensure high-accuracy results. To address this issue, we propose using progressive text prompts as prior knowledge to guide the segmentation process. Our model consists of two stages. In the first stage, we perform contrastive learning on natural images to pretrain a powerful prior prompt encoder (PPE). This PPE leverages text prior prompts to generate multimodality features. In the second stage, medical image and text prior prompts are sent into the PPE inherited from the first stage to achieve the downstream medical image segmentation task. A multiscale feature fusion block (MSFF) combines the features from the PPE to produce multiscale multimodality features. These two progressive features not only bridge the semantic gap but also improve prediction accuracy. Finally, an UpAttention block refines the predicted results by merging the image and text features. This design provides a simple and accurate way to leverage multiscale progressive text prior prompts for medical image segmentation. Compared with using only images, our model achieves high-quality results with low data annotation costs. Moreover, our model not only has excellent reliability and validity on medical images but also performs well on natural images. The experimental results on different image datasets demonstrate that our model is effective and robust for image segmentation",arXiv
Comparative genomics of novel Bacteroides acidifaciens isolates reveals candidates for adaptation to host subspecies in house mice,"The breadth of phenotypes influenced by the gut microbiome in multicellular hosts has attracted the keen and renewed interest of evolutionary biologists.  Comparative studies suggest that coevolutionary processes may occur as hosts and their associated microbes (i.e., holobionts) diverge. The majority of studies to date however lack information beyond that of 16S rRNA gene profiling, and thus fail to capture potential underlying genomic changes among microbes. In this study, we conducted a comparative genomic analysis of 19 newly sampled Bacteroides acidifaciens isolates derived from the eastern and western house mouse subspecies, Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus. Through a panel of genome-wide association (GWAS) analyses applied to pangenomic content, structural gene rearrangements, and SNPs, we reveal several candidates for adaptation to the host subspecies environment. The proportion of significant loci in each respective category is small, indicating low levels of differentiation according host subspecies. However, consistent signal is observed for genes involved in processes such as carbohydrate acquisition/utilization (SusD/RagB, amyA and amyS) and de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis (purD), which serve as promising candidates for future experimental investigation in the house mouse as a model of holobiont evolution",biorxiv
Insights into the foraging Gene's Influence on Mating Investments of Male Drosophila,"The foraging gene is a key genetic factor that modulates social behavior in insects, primarily by governing the trade-off between individual foraging and group-related activities. It has been associated with various behaviors associated with food search and resource exploitation, thereby playing a crucial role in determining the efficiency of foraging and the overall success of the collective. In this study, we investigate the critical role of the foraging gene in mediating complex interval timing behaviors, particularly mating duration, in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. By examining two distinct variant phenotypes, rover and sitter, we observe specific deficiencies in longer (LMD) and shorter mating duration (SMD) behaviors, respectively, suggesting the genes crucial influence on these interval timing mechanisms. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing and knockdown experiments, we identify the genes significant expression in key neurons involved in learning and memory. However, its impact on mating duration is not observed in these brain regions. Instead, our data reveal the genes crucial role in specific neurons expressing Pdfr, a critical regulator of circadian rhythms. Furthermore, the study uncovers sexually dimorphic expression patterns in the brain and highlights the necessity of the genes dosage in specific cell populations within the ellipsoid body for normal mating duration. These findings underscore the foraging genes pivotal role in mediating complex interval timing behaviors in Drosophila, providing valuable insights into the intricate interplay between genetics, environment, and behavior. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the genetic and neural mechanisms underlying complex interval timing behaviors, with broader implications for unraveling the function of foraging gene",biorxiv
Generative AI impact on protein stability prediction in breast cancer genes,"The functional classification of a missense variant in cancer predisposition genes is often challenging due to how rare the variant is observed in the population. When available, clinicians utilize a combination of family history, in vitro functional assays and in silico methods to infer protein function. In silico methods, such as missense predictors (predict changes in protein function) and protein stability predictors (predict changes in free energy) have been used to help classify a missense variant in accordance with the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guideline. To measure protein stability, many in silico algorithms predict stability based on the change of free energy and most accurate protein stability predictors require a wild-type protein template. In this study, we examine the use of generative AI to predict high-resolution protein structures as templates analyzed with protein stability methods to evaluate loss of function (LOF) activity in cancer predisposition genes BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 and RAD51C upon the presence of missense variant. Utilizing multiplexed assay of variant effect measurements and variant classifications from ClinVar, we find that prediction of Gibbs free energy ({Delta}{Delta}G) from AlphaFold2 (AF2) structures analyzed with FoldX predicts LOF better than experimental-derived wild type structures in the BRCT domain of BRCA1 and the DNA binding domain (DBD) of BRCA2, but not in PALB2 and RAD51C. We also find that AF2 structures in the BRCT domain of BRCA1 and DBD-Dss1 domain of BRCA2 analyzed with FoldX measure homologous DNA recombination (HDR) activity significantly better than Rosetta and DDGun3D. Our study also revealed that there are other factors that contribute to predicting loss of function activity other than protein stability, with AlphaMissense ranking the best overall predictor of LOF activity in these tumor suppressor breast cancer genes.  Author SummaryThe stability of a protein, often expressed in terms of Gibbs free energy ({Delta}{Delta}G), is a critical factor in predicting loss of function (LOF) activity when a missense variant is present. The effect is higher in haploinsufficient genes like the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 and RAD51C. Protein stability predictors that utilizes a wild-type structure to make its predictions is often limited by the availability of experimentally-derived protein structures. Here, in our study we show that generative AI, like AlphaFold2 (AF2) can predict structures similar to experimentally-derived structures with high similarity. Furthermore, protein stability tools such as FoldX, Rosetta, and DDGun3D can be used in conjunction to measure changes in stability. From our study, we find that complex AF2 structures representing the BRCT domain of BRCA1 and DBD domain of BRCA2 analyzed by FoldX predicts function significantly better than the experimentally-derived structures. However, predicted |{Delta}{Delta}G| does not predict function better than purpose-built in silico missense predictors for protein function. Overall, we find the AlphaMissense is the best predictor to predict function in these tumor suppressor breast cancer genes",biorxiv
"Phenome-wide identification of therapeutic genetic targets, leveraging knowledge graphs, graph neural networks, and UK Biobank data","The ongoing expansion of human genomic datasets propels therapeutic target identification; however, extracting gene-disease associations from gene annotations remains challenging.

A Unifying Hypothesis for the Genome Dynamics Proposed to Underlie Neuropsychiatric Phenotypes,"The sheer number of gene variants and the extent of the observed clinical and molecular heterogeneity recorded in neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) could be due to the magnified downstream effects initiated by a smaller group of genomic higher-order alterations in response to endogenous or environmental stress. Chromosomal common fragile sites (CFS) are functionally linked with microRNAs, gene copy number variants (CNVs), sub-microscopic deletions and duplications of DNA, rare single-nucleotide variants (SNVs/SNPs), and small insertions/deletions (indels), as well as chromosomal translocations, gene duplications, altered methylation, microRNA and L1 transposon activity, and 3-D chromosomal topology characteristics. These genomic structural features have been linked with various NPDs in mostly isolated reports and have usually only been viewed as areas harboring potential candidate genes of interest. The suggestion to use a higher level entry point (the 'fragilome' and associated features) activated by a central mechanism ('stress') for studying NPD genetics has the potential to unify the existing vast number of different observations in this field. This approach may explain the continuum of gene findings distributed between affected and unaffected individuals, the clustering of NPD phenotypes and overlapping comorbidities, the extensive clinical and molecular heterogeneity, and the association with certain other medical disorders",PubMed
Exploring genomic feature selection: A comparative analysis of GWAS and machine learning algorithms in a large-scale soybean dataset,"The surge in high-throughput technologies has empowered the acquisition of vast genomic datasets, prompting the search for genetic markers and biomarkers relevant to complex traits. However, grappling with the inherent complexities of high dimensionality and sparsity within these datasets poses formidable hurdles. The immense number of features and their potential redundancy demand efficient strategies for extracting pertinent information and identifying significant markers. Feature selection is important in large genomic data as it helps in enhancing interpretability and computational efficiency. This study focuses on addressing these challenges through a comprehensive investigation into genomic feature selection methodologies, employing a rich soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) dataset comprising 966 lines with over 5.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. Emphasizing the ""small n large p"" dilemma prevalent in contemporary genomic studies, we compared the efficacy of traditional genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with two prominent machine learning tools, random forest and extreme gradient boosting, in pinpointing predictive features. Utilizing the expansive soybean dataset, we assessed the performance of these methodologies in selecting features that optimize predictive modeling for various phenotypes. By constructing predictive models based on the selected features, we ascertain the comparative prediction accuracies, thereby illuminating the strengths and limitations of these feature selection methodologies in the realm of genomic data analysis",PubMed
How should cardiac xenotransplantation be initiated in Japan?,"The world's first clinical cardiac xenotransplantation, using a genetically engineered pig heart with 10 gene modifications, prolonged the life of a 57-year-old man with no other life-saving options, by 60 days. It is foreseeable that xenotransplantation will be introduced in clinical practice in the United States. However, little clinical or regulatory progress has been made in the field of xenotransplantation in Japan in recent years. Japan seems to be heading toward a ""device lag"", and the over-importation of medical devices and technology in the medical field is becoming problematic. In this review, we discuss the concept of pig-heart xenotransplantation, including the pathobiological aspects related to immune rejection, coagulation dysregulation, and detrimental heart overgrowth, as well as genetic modification strategies in pigs to prevent or minimize these problems. Moreover, we summarize the necessity for and current status of xenotransplantation worldwide, and future prospects in Japan, with the aim of initiating xenotransplantation in Japan using genetically modified pigs without a global delay. It is imperative that this study prompts the initiation of preclinical xenotransplantation research using non-human primates and leads to clinical studies",PubMed

Naturally segregating genetic variants contribute to thermal tolerance in a D. melanogaster model system,"Thermal tolerance is a fundamental physiological complex trait for survival in many species. For example, everyday tasks such as foraging, finding a mate, and avoiding predation, are highly dependent on how well an organism can tolerate extreme temperatures. Understanding the general architecture of the natural variants of the genes that control this trait is of high importance if we want to better comprehend how this trait evolves in natural populations. Here, we take a multipronged approach to further dissect the genetic architecture that controls thermal tolerance in natural populations using the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR) as a model system. First, we used quantitative genetics and Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping to identify major effect regions within the genome that influences thermal tolerance, then integrated RNA-sequencing to identify differences in gene expression, and lastly, we used the RNAi system to 1) alter tissue-specific gene expression and 2) functionally validate our findings. This powerful integration of approaches not only allows for the identification of the genetic basis of thermal tolerance but also the physiology of thermal tolerance in a natural population, which ultimately elucidates thermal tolerance through a fitness-associated lens",biorxiv
Achalasia cardia: A case report in young female,"This case emphasizes the need for early recognition and accurate diagnosis of achalasia in young adults to avoid exacerbation of the condition and misdiagnosis as GERD. Patient outcomes and quality of life are greatly enhanced by suitable diagnostic techniques, appropriate therapy, interdisciplinary care, and comprehensive patient education along with frequent follow-ups. Achalasia results from the degeneration of inhibitory ganglion cells within the esophageal myenteric plexus and the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), leading to a loss of inhibitory neurons and resulting in the absence of peristalsis with failure of LES relaxation. Its origins are multifactorial, potentially involving infections, autoimmune responses, and genetics, with equal incidence in males and females. The hallmark symptoms include progressive dysphagia for solids and liquids, along with regurgitation, heartburn, and non-cardiac chest pain. A 22-year-old female patient initially diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) received proton pump inhibitors and antacid gel for persistent dysphagia and regurgitation. Subsequent tests including barium esophagogram and manometry indicated Type II Achalasia Cardia. The patient showed clinical improvement with relief of dysphagia, regurgitation, and heartburn symptoms after pneumatic balloon dilatation (PBD). She was advised to follow up after 6 months with upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy and manometry in the outpatient clinic for regular endoscopic surveillance as there is a risk of transformation to esophageal carcinoma. Diagnosing achalasia in young adults poses challenges due to its diverse presentation and resemblance to other esophageal disorders like GERD. Diagnosis relies on clinical symptoms and imaging studies such as barium esophagogram revealing a bird's beak appearance and esophageal manometry showing absent peristalsis. UGI endoscopy is needed to rule out malignancy. Treatment options include non-surgical approaches like medication and Botox injections, as well as surgical methods such as pneumatic balloon dilation, laparoscopic Heller myotomy, and per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). The treatment options depend upon the patient's condition at presentation and their individual choices. This case report emphasizes that it is crucial to consider achalasia as a potential differential diagnosis in young adults with dysphagia, especially if conventional treatments for acid peptic disorder do not alleviate symptoms. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management can lead to significant clinical improvement and better patient outcomes",PubMed
PRPS1-associated retinopathy: a diagnostic odyssey,"This study describes how the diagnosis of Usher syndrome was revised to PRPS1-associated retinopathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 5. A 38-year-old female with bilaterally subnormal vision and non-congenital hearing loss was initially diagnosed with Usher syndrome, based on finding variants in three genes (MYO7A, USH2A, and PCDH15), was re-evaluated at the inherited retinal disorders clinic. She had asymmetric retinopathy and right macular pseudocoloboma. She was also found to have myopathic facies, poor grip strength and atrophy of the calf muscles. Whole exome sequencing including variants in PRPS1 showed a variant (NM_002764.4:c.287 G > A; p.Arg96Gln), which was not detected by targeted Sanger sequencing of the DNA from her mother and sister. The constellation of asymmetric retinopathy and non-congenital hearing impairment should prompt the clinician to search for other diagnoses that may not be covered by an Usher syndrome next generation sequencing panel. Interpretation of genetic testing results should be correlated with a detailed clinical phenotype",PubMed
Post-GWAS Prioritization of Genome-Phenome Associations in Sorghum,"This study presents an innovative approach for understanding the genetic underpinnings of two key phenotypes in Sorghum bicolor: maximum canopy height and maximum growth rate. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are widely used to decipher the genetic basis of traits in organisms, but the challenge lies in selecting an appropriate statistically significant threshold for analysis. Our goal was to employ GWAS to pinpoint the genetic markers associated with the phenotypes of interest using specific permissive-filtered threshold values that allows the inclusion of broader collections of explanatory candidate genes. Then, we utilized a pattern recognition technique to prioritize a set of informative genes, which hold potential for further investigation and could find applications in Artificial Intelligence systems. Utilizing a subset of the Sorghum Bioenergy Association Panel cultivated at the Maricopa Agricultural Center in Arizona, we sought to unveil patterns between phenotypic similarity and genetic proximity among accessions in order to organize Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) which are likely to be associated with the phenotypic trait. Additionally, we explored the impact of this method by considering all SNPs versus focusing on SNPs classified through the GWAS pre-filter. Experimental results indicated that our approach effectively prioritizes SNPs and genes influencing the phenotype of interest. Moreover, this methodology holds promise in the feature selection from genomic data for predicting complex phenotypic traits influenced by numerous genes and environmental conditions and could pave the way for further research in this field.  Author SummaryAnalyzing the relationships of an organisms phenotypes with their genotypes and environments stands as a critical aspect in plant biology. Over the past few decades, researchers have focused on identifying impactful genes controlling the plant phenotypes in diverse environmental conditions, a pursuit especially relevant in the face of global climate change. Applied field experiments and quantitative genetics have identified numerous regions of the genome influencing complex traits. However, the substantial time and cost required for physical experiments have prompted the use of computational methods to facilitate this field of research. Our work aims to unravel the patterns between phenotypic similarity and genetic proximity across a panel of sorghum accessions to prioritize genes influencing the phenotype of interest. Our results suggest that this method is an effective way to prioritize informative genes for further analysis, and for genomic features selection that can be used by machine learning and deep learning algorithms for predicting complex phenotypic traits",biorxiv
Congenital Hyperinsulinism of a Large Italian Cohort: A Retrospective Study,"To evaluate and describe the diagnostic process, medical, nutritional, and surgical approach, and neurological outcome, we report data from a large Italian cohort of patients with congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI). We retrospectively analyzed 154 CHI patients admitted to Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesù from 1985 to 2022. Hypoglycemia occurred within the first year of life in 85.5% of patients, median time to diagnosis was 1 day (IQR 14 days). Ninety-two percent of patients were treated with diazoxide: 66.9% were responsive. Octreotide was administered to 28.6% of patients: 61.4% were responsive. Forty percent of patients were off-therapy, mostly from diazoxide. Thirty-four percent of patients carried mutations in ABCC8, 12.6% were syndromic, and 9.2% were transient CHI. Surgery was performed in 23/47 diazoxide-unresponsive and 2/95 diazoxide-responsive patients: 64.0% were focal at histology. Combining data from genetics, pancreatic venous sampling, 18F-DOPA PET/CT, and histology, 80.6% resulted diffuse, 16.7% focal, and 2.8% atypical CHI. Post-surgical diabetes developed in 6 patients. Neurocognitive evaluation revealed developmental delay or intellectual disability in 15.7% of 70 patients, mostly of a mild degree. Epilepsy was documented in 13.7% of 139 patients. Our diagnostic and therapeutic results are mainly consistent with the international indications and the CHI Global Registry data, with relatively low rates of neurological outcomes. Good outcomes were likely associated with early diagnosis and prompt management of patients because the majority of patients were diagnosed within 2 weeks. Remarkably, it is of utmost importance to spread the knowledge and refer CHI patients to multidisciplinary expert centers",PubMed
A comparative evaluation of ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4 in responses to selected genetics questions,"To evaluate the efficacy of ChatGPT 4 (GPT-4) in delivering genetic information about BRCA1, HFE, and MLH1, building on previous findings with ChatGPT 3.5 (GPT-3.5). To focus on assessing the utility, limitations, and ethical implications of using ChatGPT in medical settings. A structured survey was developed to assess GPT-4's clinical value. An expert panel of genetic counselors and clinical geneticists evaluated GPT-4's responses to these questions. We also performed comparative analysis with GPT-3.5, utilizing descriptive statistics and using Prism 9 for data analysis. The findings indicate improved accuracy in GPT-4 over GPT-3.5 (P < .0001). However, notable errors in accuracy remained. The relevance of responses varied in GPT-4, but was generally favorable, with a mean in the ""somewhat agree"" range. There was no difference in performance by disease category. The 7-question subset of the Bot Usability Scale (BUS-15) showed no statistically significant difference between the groups but trended lower in the GPT-4 version. The study underscores GPT-4's potential role in genetic education, showing notable progress yet facing challenges like outdated information and the necessity of ongoing refinement. Our results, while showing promise, emphasizes the importance of balancing technological innovation with ethical responsibility in healthcare information delivery",PubMed
"""Having cancer is very expensive"": A qualitative study of patients with ovarian cancer and PARP inhibitor treatment","To examine patient barriers and facilitators to PARP inhibitor (PARP-I) maintenance therapy in ovarian cancer. PARP-I improves survival in ovarian cancer, but these multi-year therapies cost around $100,000 annually and are under-prescribed. We recruited patients with ovarian cancer treated with PARP-I maintenance therapy at an academic health system for a semi-structured interview. Patient demographics, including genetics and PARP-I cost, were self-reported. We assessed patient experiences with barriers and facilitators of PARP-I usage. Two team members used a thematic approach to analyze and identify key themes. In May 2022, we interviewed 10 patients (mean age = 65 years; 80% White; 60% with a germline genetic mutation). Patients paid on average $227.50 monthly for PARP-I, straining resources for some participants. While sampled patients were insured, all patients identified having no or inadequate insurance as a major barrier to PARP-I. At the same time, all participants prioritized clinical effectiveness over costs of care. Patients identified PARP-I delivery from specialty pharmacies, separate and different from other medications, as a potential barrier, but each had been able to navigate delivery. Patients expressed significant initial side effects of PARP-I as a potential barrier yet reported clinician communication and prompt dose reduction as facilitating continuation. Patients identified cost, restrictive pharmacy benefits, and initial side effects as barriers to PARP-I usage. Having insurance and a supportive care team were identified as facilitators. Enhancing communication about PARP-I cost and side effects could improve patient experience and receipt of evidence-based maintenance therapy in ovarian cancer",PubMed
Utilization of a Third-party Partnership in Tele-genetic Risk Assessment Program in Genitourinary Oncology,"To meet the increasing demands of genetic risk assessment for genitourinary cancers due to expanded clinical guidelines, we established an academic/industry partnership to create a streamlined workflow to overcome the barriers to access to care. Genome Medical offers multilingual genetic counseling. A pilot program evaluated patients at risk for hereditary genitourinary syndromes. Between January 1, 2020 and January 07, 2022, all patients in need of germline testing were offered hybrid in-clinic telehealth pre-test counseling and when indicated, genetic testing. Post-test counseling was offered based on results and encouraged if positive. Testing results, patient satisfaction, and costs were evaluated. A total of 146 of 182 (80.0%) patients agreed to participate, with 130 (89.0%) completing pre-test counseling. Median age was 65 (range 22-95), with 91% being male and approximately 60% having prostate cancer. The median time from referral to pre-test counseling was 11 days (IQR 7-20). After assessment, testing was recommended for 127 (97.7%) of which 123 (96.8%) completed testing. The median time from testing to result release was 15 days (IQR 10-20.8). Forty (32.5%) had post-test counseling. Reimbursement by private insurers increased annually from $17.2 to $52.4. Patient satisfaction was high with a mean Genetic Counselor Satisfaction Scale of 27.9 out of 30. Our program provided high patient satisfaction, rapid access to genetic counseling, prompt genetic testing, timely release of results, and was cost-effective compared to traditional models. This approach is scalable across community and academic settings and across cancer types",PubMed
SAFPred: synteny-aware gene function prediction for bacteria using protein embeddings,"Today, we know the function of only a small fraction of the protein sequences predicted from genomic data. This problem is even more salient for bacteria, which represent some of the most phylogenetically and metabolically diverse taxa on Earth. This low rate of bacterial gene annotation is compounded by the fact that most function prediction algorithms have focused on eukaryotes, and conventional annotation approaches rely on the presence of similar sequences in existing databases. However, often there are no such sequences for novel bacterial proteins. Thus, we need improved gene function prediction methods tailored for bacteria. Recently, transformer-based language models-adopted from the natural language processing field-have been used to obtain new representations of proteins, to replace amino acid sequences. These representations, referred to as protein embeddings, have shown promise for improving annotation of eukaryotes, but there have been only limited applications on bacterial genomes. To predict gene functions in bacteria, we developed SAFPred, a novel synteny-aware gene function prediction tool based on protein embeddings from state-of-the-art protein language models. SAFpred also leverages the unique operon structure of bacteria through conserved synteny. SAFPred outperformed both conventional sequence-based annotation methods and state-of-the-art methods on multiple bacterial species, including for distant homolog detection, where the sequence similarity to the proteins in the training set was as low as 40%. Using SAFPred to identify gene functions across diverse enterococci, of which some species are major clinical threats, we identified 11 previously unrecognized putative novel toxins, with potential significance to human and animal health. https://github.com/AbeelLab/safpred",PubMed
Malignant tumors in tuberous sclerosis complex: a case report and review of the literature,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare, autosomal dominant genetic disease that arises from TSC1 or TSC2 genetic mutations. These genetic mutations can induce the development of benign tumors in any organ system with significant clinical implications in morbidity and mortality. In rare instances, patients with TSC can have malignant tumors, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET). It is considered a hereditary renal cancer syndrome despite the low incidence of RCC in TSC patients. TSC is typically diagnosed in prenatal and pediatric patients and frequently associated with neurocognitive disorders and seizures, which are often experienced early in life. However, penetrance and expressivity of TSC mutations are highly variable. Herein, we present a case report, with associated literature, to highlight that there exist undiagnosed adult patients with less penetrant features, whose clinical presentation may contain non-classical signs and symptoms, who have pathogenic TSC mutations. A 31-year-old female with past medical history of leiomyomas status post myomectomy presented to the emergency department for a hemorrhagic adnexal cyst. Imaging incidentally identified a renal mass suspicious for RCC. Out of concern for hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) syndrome, the mass was surgically removed and confirmed as RCC. Discussion with medical genetics ascertained a family history of kidney cancer and nephrectomy procedures and a patient history of ungual fibromas on the toes. Genetic testing for hereditary kidney cancer revealed a 5'UTR deletion in the TSC1 gene, leading to a diagnosis of TSC. Following the diagnosis, dermatology found benign skin findings consistent with TSC. About six months after the incidental finding of RCC, a PNET in the pancreatic body/tail was incidentally found on chest CT imaging, which was removed and determined to be a well-differentiated PNET. Later, a brain MRI revealed two small cortical tubers, one in each frontal lobe, that were asymptomatic; the patient's history and family history did not contain seizures or learning delays. The patient presently shows no evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease, and no additional malignant tumors have been identified. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of a TSC patient without a history of neurocognitive disorders with RCC and PNET, both independently rare occurrences in TSC. The patient had a strong family history of renal disease, including RCC, and had several other clinical manifestations of TSC, including skin and brain findings. The incidental finding and surgical removal of RCC prompted the genetic evaluation and diagnosis of TSC, leading to a comparably late diagnosis for this patient. Reporting the broad spectrum of disease for TSC, including more malignant phenotypes such as the one seen in our patient, can help healthcare providers better identify patients who need genetic evaluation and additional medical care",PubMed
Anaplerotic nutrient stress drives synergy of angiogenesis inhibitors with therapeutics targeting tumor metabolism,"Tumor angiogenesis is a cancer hallmark, and its therapeutic inhibition has provided meaningful, albeit limited, clinical benefit. While anti-angiogenesis inhibitors deprive the tumor of oxygen and essential nutrients, cancer cells activate metabolic adaptations to diminish therapeutic response. Despite these adaptations, angiogenesis inhibition incurs extensive metabolic stress, prompting us to consider such metabolic stress as an induced vulnerability to therapies targeting cancer metabolism. Metabolomic profiling of angiogenesis-inhibited intracranial xenografts showed universal decrease in tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, corroborating a state of anaplerotic nutrient deficit or stress. Accordingly, we show strong synergy between angiogenesis inhibitors (Avastin, Tivozanib) and inhibitors of glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation through exacerbation of anaplerotic nutrient stress in intracranial orthotopic xenografted gliomas. Our findings were recapitulated in GBM xenografts that do not have genetically predisposed metabolic vulnerabilities at baseline. Thus, our findings cement the central importance of the tricarboxylic acid cycle as the nexus of metabolic vulnerabilities and suggest clinical path hypothesis combining angiogenesis inhibitors with pharmacological cancer interventions targeting tumor metabolism for GBM tumors",biorxiv
Macrophage-mediated myelin recycling fuels brain cancer malignancy,"Tumors growing in metabolically challenged environments, such as glioblastoma in the brain, are particularly reliant on crosstalk with their tumor microenvironment (TME) to satisfy their high energetic needs. To study the intricacies of this metabolic interplay, we interrogated the heterogeneity of the glioblastoma TME using single-cell and multi-omics analyses and identified metabolically rewired tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) subpopulations with pro-tumorigenic properties. These TAM subsets, termed lipid-laden macrophages (LLMs) to reflect their cholesterol accumulation, are epigenetically rewired, display immunosuppressive features, and are enriched in the aggressive mesenchymal glioblastoma subtype. Engulfment of cholesterol-rich myelin debris endows subsets of TAMs to acquire an LLM phenotype. Subsequently, LLMs directly transfer myelin-derived lipids to cancer cells in an LXR/Abca1-dependent manner, thereby fueling the heightened metabolic demands of mesenchymal glioblastoma. Our work provides an in-depth understanding of the immune-metabolic interplay during glioblastoma progression, thereby laying a framework to unveil targetable metabolic vulnerabilities in glioblastoma",PubMed
Consenso mexicano de tirosinemia tipo 1,"Tyrosinemia type 1 is a rare disease with autosomal recessive inheritance, featuring various clinical manifestations. These may encompass acute neonatal liver failure, neonatal cholestatic syndrome, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and, alternatively, kidney disorders like renal tubular acidosis, Fanconi syndrome, hypophosphatemic rickets, among other alterations. Diagnosis relies on detecting toxic metabolites in the blood and urine, ideally confirmed through molecular testing. A consensus was reached with experts in the field of inborn errors of metabolism (EIM), including eight pediatric gastroenterologists, two EIM specialists, two geneticists, three pediatric nutritionists specialized in EIM, and a pediatric surgeon specializing in transplants. Six working groups were tasked with formulating statements and justifications, and 32 statements were anonymously voted on using the Likert scale and the Delphi method. The first virtual vote achieved an 80% consensus, with the remaining 20% determined in person. The statements were categorized into epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, nutritional and medical treatment, and genetic counseling.

PGSbuilder: An end-to-end platform for human genome association analysis and polygenic risk score predictions,"Understanding the genetic basis of human complex diseases is increasingly important in the development of precision medicine. Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become a key technique for detecting associations between common diseases and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present in a cohort of individuals. Alternatively, the polygenic risk score (PRS), which often applies results from GWAS summary statistics, is calculated for the estimation of genetic propensity to a trait at the individual level. Despite many GWAS and PRS tools being available to analyze a large volume of genotype data, most clinicians and medical researchers are often not familiar with the bioinformatics tools and lack access to a high-performance computing cluster resource. To fill this gap, we provide a publicly available web server, PGSbuilder, for the GWAS and PRS analysis of human genomes with variant annotations. The user-friendly and intuitive PGSbuilder web server is developed to facilitate the discovery of the genetic variants associated with complex traits and diseases for medical professionals with limited computational skills. For GWAS analysis, PGSbuilder provides the most renowned analysis tool PLINK 2.0 package. For PRS, PGSbuilder provides six different PRS methods including Clumping and Thresholding, Lassosum, LDPred2, GenEpi, PRS-CS, and PRSice2. Furthermore, PGSbuilder provides an intuitive user interface to examine the annotated functional effects of variants from known biomedical databases and relevant literature using advanced natural language processing approaches.

"Inflammatory bowel disease genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metagenomics meet artificial intelligence","Various extrinsic and intrinsic factors such as drug exposures, antibiotic treatments, smoking, lifestyle, genetics, immune responses, and the gut microbiome characterize ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, collectively called inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). All these factors contribute to the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease etiology and pathogenesis leading to major challenges for the scientific community in improving management, medical treatments, genetic risk, and exposome impact. Understanding the interaction(s) among these factors and their effects on the immune system in IBD patients has prompted advances in multi-omics research, the development of new tools as part of system biology, and more recently, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches. These innovative approaches, supported by the availability of big data and large volumes of digital medical datasets, hold promise in better understanding the natural histories, predictors of disease development, severity, complications and treatment outcomes in complex diseases, providing decision support to doctors, and promising to bring us closer to the realization of the ""precision medicine"" paradigm. This review aims to provide an overview of current IBD omics based on both individual (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metagenomics) and multi-omics levels, highlighting how AI can facilitate the integration of heterogeneous data to summarize our current understanding of the disease and to identify current gaps in knowledge to inform upcoming research in this field",PubMed

Using LLMs to label medical papers according to the CIViC evidence model,"We introduce the sequence classification problem CIViC Evidence to the field of medical NLP. CIViC Evidence denotes the multi-label classification problem of assigning labels of clinical evidence to abstracts of scientific papers which have examined various combinations of genomic variants, cancer types, and treatment approaches. We approach CIViC Evidence using different language models: We fine-tune pretrained checkpoints of BERT and RoBERTa on the CIViC Evidence dataset and challenge their performance with models of the same architecture which have been pretrained on domain-specific text. In this context, we find that BiomedBERT and BioLinkBERT can outperform BERT on CIViC Evidence (+0.8% and +0.9% absolute improvement in class-support weighted F1 score). All transformer-based models show a clear performance edge when compared to a logistic regression trained on bigram tf-idf scores (+1.5 - 2.7% improved F1 score). We compare the aforementioned BERT-like models to OpenAI's GPT-4 in a few-shot setting (on a small subset of our original test dataset), demonstrating that, without additional prompt-engineering or fine-tuning, GPT-4 performs worse on CIViC Evidence than our six fine-tuned models (66.1% weighted F1 score compared to 71.8% for the best fine-tuned model). However, performance gets reasonably close to the benchmark of a logistic regression model trained on bigram tf-idf scores (67.7% weighted F1 score)",arXiv
"Optogenetics and Targeted Gene Therapy for Retinal Diseases: Unravelling the Fundamentals, Applications, and Future Perspectives","With a common aim of restoring physiological function of defective cells, optogenetics and targeted gene therapies have shown great clinical potential and novelty in the branch of personalized medicine and inherited retinal diseases (IRDs). The basis of optogenetics aims to bypass defective photoreceptors by introducing opsins with light-sensing capabilities. In contrast, targeted gene therapies, such as methods based on CRISPR-Cas9 and RNA interference with noncoding RNAs (i.e., microRNA, small interfering RNA, short hairpin RNA), consists of inducing normal gene or protein expression into affected cells. Having partially leveraged the challenges limiting their prompt introduction into the clinical practice (i.e., engineering, cell or tissue delivery capabilities), it is crucial to deepen the fields of knowledge applied to optogenetics and targeted gene therapy. The aim of this in-depth and novel literature review is to explain the fundamentals and applications of optogenetics and targeted gene therapies, while providing decision-making arguments for ophthalmologists. First, we review the biomolecular principles and engineering steps involved in optogenetics and the targeted gene therapies mentioned above by bringing a focus on the specific vectors and molecules for cell signalization. The importance of vector choice and engineering methods are discussed. Second, we summarize the ongoing clinical trials and most recent discoveries for optogenetics and targeted gene therapies for IRDs. Finally, we then discuss the limits and current challenges of each novel therapy. We aim to provide for the first time scientific-based explanations for clinicians to justify the specificity of each therapy for one disease, which can help improve clinical decision-making tasks",PubMed
Towards a new standard in genomic data privacy: a realization of owner-governance,"With the rapid developments in sequencing technologies, individuals now have unprecedented access to their genomic data. However, existing data management systems or protocols are inadequate for protecting privacy, limiting individuals control over their genomic information, hindering data sharing, and posing a challenge for biomedical research. To fill the gap, an owner-governed system that fulfills owner authority, lifecycle data encryption, and verifiability at the same time is prompted. In this paper, we realized Governome, an owner-governed data management system designed to empower individuals with absolute control over their genomic data during data sharing. Governome uses a blockchain to manage all transactions and permissions, enabling data owners with dynamic permission management and to be fully informed about every data usage. It uses homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs to enable genomic data storage and computation in an encrypted and verifiable form for its whole lifecycle.

"A recently collected Xanthomonas translucens isolate encodes TAL effectors distinct from older, less virulent isolates","Xanthomonas translucens, the causal agent of bacterial leaf streak disease (BLS) in cereals, is a re-emerging pathogen that is becoming increasingly destructive across the world. While BLS has caused yield losses in the past, there is anecdotal evidence that newer isolates may be more virulent. We observed that two Xanthomonas translucens isolates collected from two sites in Colorado are more aggressive on current wheat and barley varieties compared to older isolates, and we hypothesize that genetic changes between recent and older isolates contribute to the differences in isolate aggressiveness. To test this, we phenotyped and genetically characterized two X. translucens isolates collected from Colorado in 2018, which we designated CO236 (from barley) and CO237 (from wheat). Using pathovar-specific phenotyping and PCR primers, we determined that CO236 belongs to pathovar translucens and CO237 belongs to pathovar undulosa. We sequenced the full genomes of the isolates using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing, and compared their whole genomes against published X. translucens genomes. This analysis confirmed our pathovar designations for Xtt CO236 and Xtu CO237, and showed that, at the whole-genome level, there were no obvious genomic structural changes between Xtt CO236 and Xtu CO237 and other respective published pathovar genomes. Focusing on pathovar undulosa (Xtu CO237), we then compared putative Type III effectors among all available Xtu isolate genomes and found that they were highly conserved. However, there were striking differences in the presence and sequence of various transcription activator-like effectors (TALE) between Xtu CO237 and published undulosa genomes, which correlate with isolate virulence. Here, we explore the potential implications of the differences in these virulence factors, and provide possible explanations for the increased virulence of recently-emerged isolates.  Data SummaryA list of all Xanthomonas accessions used in this study can be found in Supplemental Table S1. Xtt CO236 and Xtu CO237 genomic sequences are deposited in GenBank (Accession: PRJNA1017868 and PRJNA1017870, respectively). Software packages for the custom Conda environment used in this analysis can be found in Supplemental Table S4. The dataset from the MinION reads from CO236 and CO237 can be found in Dryad, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.d51c5b06q. Custom bash and Python scripts for the effector analysis are available in (https://github.com/robertslabcsu/xanthanalysis.git).  Impact statementXanthomonas translucens is a destructive, re-emerging pathogen of cereal crops with no known resistance or methods for chemical control. Recent isolates have increased virulence compared to older isolates, which emphasizes the need to understand how virulence evolves, and how the pathogen interacts with its host, to find new ways to manage the disease. Here, we identify potential virulence factors that contribute to the increased aggressiveness observed in two recently collected Colorado isolates, with potential impacts on understanding pathogen host range and evolution",biorxiv
